1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,930
This normally wouldn't be an
hour, but we're going to chop it

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,760
down and speed it up and keep
the back half hour for q&a as we

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,640
go. Great. So we're gonna talk
about hiring a head of product.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,030
And as Mark said, I think this
is really a general topic. But

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,870
because I'm a pure software
product management guy, I'm

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,590
telling it from my side of the
story. So, you know, we'll be

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,740
able to generalize quite a bit,
but we'll take it from that

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,280
point of view.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,370
Okay, just a very brief
introduction for me. Quick hint,

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm on the right in this photo.
On the left is my other office

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,230
manager, Celeste, Olivia may
join us as you saw during the

12
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,400
warm up. So what's important
about this for the talk is to

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,360
set up why I think I might have
something to say about it. I'm a

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,520
30 plus year veteran of Silicon
Valley b2b enterprise software.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,910
So I had my first product
management job in the late 80s.

16
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,940
It's not a new thing. And these
days, I'm spending a lot of my

17
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,240
time helping software companies
design their product

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,160
organizations, coaching their
product leaders. And then you

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,860
know, the statistic that's
probably important here. So in

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,210
the last 19 years, since I went
solo, I've done about 150

21
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,720
engagements with different
clients, of which a dozen are

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,200
what we've called the
smokejumper, VP product jobs. So

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,230
that's where I come into a
company as the interim or

24
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,590
temporary head of product for
usually a couple of quarters and

25
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,800
get everything straightened out.
I've also done a little over a

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,210
dozen assistance roles where I
help my clients figure out who

27
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,580
they need as head of product,
and then interview the

28
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,140
candidates and be part of the
the assessment team, which is

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,600
really where this is coming out.
So having done a few dozen of

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,470
these, I may be, you know, more
frequently in this role than

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,710
anyone else on the planet other
than folks who are in the search

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,550
business themselves.

33
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,090
So I've tried to pull together
some observations that might be

34
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,940
useful for us, you know, of
course in the narrow: how do we

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,840
hire head of product? And in the
broader: How do we apply lessons

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,130
to some of the other
departments?

37
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,830
Okay, let's jump in. The first
challenge I think we have is,

38
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,890
nobody seems to know what to
call this job. So here's our

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,900
caped crusader hero, we don't
know this dog's name. But what I

40
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,800
observe is that I'm going to use
the phrase head of product, H O,

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,380
P, because we need to call it
something. And I'm going to

42
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,300
specifically say that what we're
talking about is folks who

43
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,930
manage product managers. Again,
this would seem obvious, most of

44
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,970
this is obvious, but I'm
discovering that it's not.

45
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,030
Sometimes we call those folks
Chief Product Officer, VP,

46
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,190
Product Director, product,
group, product, lead, whatever,

47
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,180
whatever. And this person might
also have, I don't know, a

48
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,200
couple of designers, there might
be a market research person or

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,910
whatever. But I'm specifically
going to not talk about folks

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,760
who are mostly running
development or engineering

51
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,670
teams. So there's lots of the
piece of product out there with

52
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,050
many different names CIO, CTO,
General Manager, I observed that

53
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,510
if you are managing, let's say,
85 developers, and for product

54
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,690
managers, most of your brain is
on the development side of the

55
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,390
house, not the product side of
the house. So I'm going to not

56
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,330
include those folks in our
little breakdown here.

57
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,230
Okay, here's our little bad dog.
And, and a few of the failures

58
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,860
that I see over and over again,
as we say, you know, what are

59
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,360
the primary failures that either
I'm called in to fix, or I'm

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,020
stuck on the side of the road
watching the accidents for, and

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,200
The first one, which is maybe
where we're gonna spend most of

62
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,620
there's really three.

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,060
our time for the next 40
minutes, is companies that hire

64
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,940
somebody to be the head of
product, who's neither led a

65
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,060
product team, nor been a product
manager, this is a head

66
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,490
scratcher for me, but we'll
break it down a little bit.

67
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,070
The second failure mode I see
is, if you're the first product

68
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,010
person in the door at a startup,
or the first head of product at

69
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,820
a startup, it's pretty rare for
the founders to actually give up

70
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,300
the autonomy and control that
they need for you to succeed,

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,200
even though they say they do.
And so I see the duration of

72
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,800
that first head of product being
pretty short. The acronym

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,120
sometimes we use his MTBE,
meantime between executives.

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,750
And then the third thing that
really contributes I think to

75
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,470
what we're going to see is that
many of the folks at software

76
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,320
companies who lead software
companies who found companies

77
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,220
don't actually understand what
product management does. And so

78
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,010
they've got some real
misapprehensions or confusion

79
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,710
around what it is that they need
and have a product.

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,700
Okay, so because I don't want to
be talking the whole time, we're

81
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,750
going to do a little experiment
here. We're going to try a bit

82
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,530
of a tweetstorm. So if I can ask
get everybody to open up their

83
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,890
chat box. And here's the
question I want you to ask,

84
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,500
don't hit return yet. So type in
your answer, and then we'll all

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,800
hit it at once. So we can all
see it at once. If you are going

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,240
to be interviewing somebody as
your new potential VP of sales

87
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,510
or Chief Revenue Officer, what's
the first question or two, you

88
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,860
would want to ask them? I'll
give everybody a minute. And

89
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,080
then count to three, count to
four, count to five. All right,

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,020
when you have an answer, hit
Return, and I'll pick a few of

91
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,350
them out of here. Okay, that's
right.

92
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,320
Tell me about your first sales
job. How do you increase sales?

93
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,470
What's your sales strategy?
What's your sales process?

94
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,110
Excellent. How much revenue did
you earn last year? What was

95
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,770
your quota?

96
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,530
So those are all questions that
would suggest that we'd really

97
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,020
like to have somebody as our VP
of sales or chief revenue

98
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,350
officer who has been a
salesperson and maybe lead

99
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,990
salespeople. Because it turns
out there's a lot of art and

100
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,840
science. Yes, I do know Paul
Kenny, and I think he's

101
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,580
brilliant. And I rarely see a
company that hires a head of

102
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,310
sales who has not been in sales
before, although, in full

103
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,670
disclosure, one of my clients
had somebody running sales who's

104
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,700
really a finance guy from m&a.
And that's a lot more

105
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,300
challenging. Likewise, if we're
going to hire somebody, as our

106
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,760
Chief Financial Officer, we'd
really like to know that they

107
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,050
understand payroll, and how to
run an accounts payable or

108
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,040
receivables group, how to keep
our executives out of jail by

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,010
not running out of money. If
we're gonna hire somebody who's

110
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,700
a VP of engineering or a CTO, we
might, for instance, want them

111
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,150
to have built software before
that would be really handy.

112
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,050
Maybe even run a software team
or two, because if we dropped

113
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,930
somebody in his VP of
engineering, who thinks that

114
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,530
software is neat, and might like
to build some, someday, we've

115
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,220
got a lot of hurt on our hands.
Again, it would seem obvious,

116
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,120
but what I noticed over and over
again, and it's Tuesday, I had

117
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,620
this discussion twice yesterday
with some of my clients were at

118
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,860
the very, very top in the very
first position of the

119
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,340
requirements for this job of
head of product, what we don't

120
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:15,240
find is, in a product manager,
run a product team. Okay, so

121
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,510
let's, let's get back to our
animals just a little bit and

122
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,690
consider some different animals
we might want for this job.

123
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,330
All right. Certainly here,
here's my ideal candidate for

124
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,670
the head of product, you'll
notice this Australian Shepherd

125
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,780
is going to move the sheep
along. Everything about this

126
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,970
head of product job,
particularly at a startup that's

127
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,360
trying to find its way is
thinking about the market and

128
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,510
the segments, not the
individual, not the one sheep,

129
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,690
we've got to move the whole herd
to wherever the water is,

130
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,900
instead of letting them wander
in all directions. Do we have a

131
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,290
clear strategy? Is it tied to
what our development team is

132
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,530
going to do? We're going to
measure outcomes, can we move

133
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,460
the whole company along toward
our product goal and our revenue

134
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,960
goal. An important useful fact
here is that nobody works for

135
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,930
product management, we've got
lots of responsibility and

136
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,770
absolutely no authority. So
other than nipping at our heels

137
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,640
and moving people along, you
know, not many sticks to

138
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,240
swinging there. And a lot of it
is about long term thinking, if

139
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,880
we're going to get the whole
company toward a strategic

140
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,670
outcome, we're all going to have
to work together, we're going to

141
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,480
reduce distractions, we're going
to block interrupts, we're going

142
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,450
to hate one off requests from
customers that somehow are going

143
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,350
to distract us.

144
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,000
And I know as, as the many time
had a product, every single

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,460
department in the company is
going to wander at some point.

146
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,530
And we're going to have to keep
calling them back with

147
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,160
reminders. Who are we selling
to? Why are they going to buy?

148
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,250
Is this the most wonderful
thing? How do we talk about it?

149
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,580
Okay, so there's our animal
choice for head of product.

150
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,260
Let's pick a few more. Here's
our Chief Revenue Officer, our

151
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,080
VP of sales, very aggressive by
nature, you know, fast, lethal.

152
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,100
But what else do we know about
these, these hunting cats,

153
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,730
they're very focused, they bring
in the red meat, they tend to be

154
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,030
single account focused, right?
They're gonna find the weakest

155
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,730
prey out there, whichever the
envelope is easier to bring

156
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,870
down. And they're tremendously
focused on the current quarter.

157
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,830
Every salesperson I know can
tell me to the exact number, how

158
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,080
many days are left in the
quarter and how much of their

159
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,830
quota they've retired. And they
strongly believe that they

160
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,650
really know exactly what the
customer wants, even though

161
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,190
everything about selling is
about pushing our point of view

162
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,400
and getting the users or the
buyers or their prospects to say

163
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,540
yes, instead of delving deeply
and finding out what their real

164
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,100
issues are, so we can solve
them.

165
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,170
When I see product management
teams working for sales - so

166
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,680
either we move the product team
under the sales organization, or

167
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,840
we bring a head of sales over to
run product very quickly. What

168
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,860
we discover is the whole product
team has really become the order

169
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,450
ticking handmaidens to sales.
We're working on single decks

170
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,470
for single meetings or
customers. And we've given up

171
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,580
our whole strategic roadmap in
favor of whatever the top few

172
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,210
customers have asked for in the
last, I don't know, 10 minutes.

173
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:18,840
Okay.

174
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,680
So while I love having a head of
sales, a chief revenue officer,

175
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,350
and I've failed at doing it
myself, so I know it's really

176
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,460
hard, I can't see bringing those
folks in to run a product team.

177
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,150
Okay, some other choices. For
any of you who are CEOs, I hope

178
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,430
this looks familiar. When I see
a CEO who's doing well seven

179
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,640
other things, and has one of the
eight tentacles on the product

180
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,440
side, we've got a part time time
sliced person running product.

181
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,970
Generally, the failures I see
are around sampling. Many of you

182
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:56,190
who been CEOs know that the most
frequent calls you get are for

183
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,340
some big current customer who's
unhappy, because you never hear

184
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,070
from the small ones. And from
all of your sales teams to help

185
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,790
you lobby the next sales deal.
So you've got a very strange

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,480
recency bias view of life. And
you're not going to be able to

187
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,080
spend the time to worry about
strategy and product and pricing

188
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,140
and positioning and all the
things that product needs to do.

189
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,130
So we need one of these CEOs,
but we sure don't need them as a

190
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:20,850
head of product.

191
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,840
Okay, a few more choices. Let's
think about our VP engineering

192
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,010
because often, I see the product
team tucked in under the CTO,

193
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,910
the CIO, the VP engineering, and
these tend to be a lot more

194
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,070
methodical, they're orderly,
they're thoughtful, they're

195
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,240
patient, tough, right? Many of
them are nocturnal. We don't see

196
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,970
them so much early in the
office. And while they're very

197
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,020
communicative, they're mostly
communicate over Slack. So we

198
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,140
don't hear from them that much.
We know they're emotional, but

199
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:54,300
we don't see it so much. And
what I see often with VPs of

200
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,980
engineering, is they have this
very odd strange belief that all

201
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,640
of our customers are rational,
that they evaluate all the tech

202
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,200
or product strictly on a
rational straightforward bases.

203
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,740
And that buying and selling are
easy that what sales reps do is

204
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,010
they bring a price list and a
presentation, and they collect

205
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,580
purchase orders. So while it's
great, again, to have a VP of

206
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,120
engineering, they those folks
tend not to have strong

207
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,440
understanding of selling, or
marketing or positioning, or

208
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,650
many of the things that we have
to do on the product side. So

209
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,610
stuff gets sold. So not as bad
as some of the other choices.

210
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,700
But again, not my favorite,
let's go we have a couple more

211
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,270
choices.

212
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,040
Here's some folks I love at
every company I've ever worked

213
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,710
for. They're the customer
support and Customer Success

214
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,980
people. What do we know about
them? We know they're

215
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,330
tremendously huge supporters of
their customers, they're going

216
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,060
to go the extra, not just the
single kilometer, they'll

217
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,080
they'll go the extra 100 miles,
they do tend to be single

218
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,130
customer or single account folks
at a time. Often your customer

219
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,390
success team is assigned long
term to just one customer. And

220
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,060
as you can see here, they're
willing to take that one

221
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,230
customer over every bump and
through every traffic signal and

222
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,140
stopping at every corner,
whether that's good for the

223
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,980
company or not as a whole. So
they're never trained to say no,

224
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,270
they're trained to say yes, and
to help that one customer figure

225
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,930
out how to do the one special
thing. When we put our product

226
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,620
hats on, we usually take a
different point of view. Instead

227
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,800
of asking how we can help be of
the most help to our next

228
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,320
customer. We ask how we can
engineer away most of the human

229
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,100
support, can we make onboarding
easier? Can we create tools? Can

230
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,580
we make the workflows better?
How do we get out from under the

231
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,110
support and success work as
opposed to do more of it? And

232
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,090
know that we're the most
important folks on the planet?

233
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,500
Okay, take a breath here. I
think we've got maybe one more.

234
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,370
Here's the one that doesn't
happen so often, but I run into

235
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,270
sometimes we'll take a moment
because you all know what the

236
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:12,510
picture is going to be right? So
here's my new baby puppy, six

237
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,220
weeks, or maybe six months as a
product manager, excuse me, I

238
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,400
usually expect it's going to
take maybe three or four years

239
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,360
to grow this puppy up to be a
really, really terrific product

240
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,630
manager and another three or
four years to grow them up to be

241
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,150
a product leader where there
might be a director and heading

242
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,840
up a team.

243
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,260
And most importantly, having
done this a bunch of times I

244
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,230
know that when I', hiring
somebody who's never been a

245
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,050
product manager before I as the
product leader, I'm going to

246
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,830
spend a lot of time house
training, right coaching and

247
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,160
mentoring and business life
skills. We're not going to send

248
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,370
this puppy in to an important
meeting with our biggest

249
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,410
customer until we've given it
some training. And as every head

250
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,200
of product knows, there's going
to be a bunch of accidents and

251
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,110
we may have to clean up the
carpet. Add or even replace it a

252
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,720
few times. So, while I love
having newly minted or freshly

253
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,950
arrived product managers on the
team, I wouldn't put them in as

254
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,730
head of product.

255
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,130
Okay, so we're through most of
our animals. Let's, let's open

256
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:24,210
this up. Where are we? Here we
go. And I think we want to, we

257
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,070
want to ask you guys again,
let's come back to our

258
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,010
tweetstorm. Just for fun,
because I'm going to give us

259
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,950
briefly really three different
thoughts for, you know,

260
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,760
misconceptions that may be
underlying this. And I'm having

261
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,310
a lot of trouble finding my chat
window, but I'm sure we'll get

262
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:50,220
there. So go ahead. If anybody
has an idea, why don't you give

263
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,920
me an idea - one or two or three
- type them in, something that's

264
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,950
a core misconception from the
rest of the executive team,

265
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,460
about what product leadership is
or what we need? So I can break

266
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,450
those down. And don't wait, just
drop them in. It's just about

267
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,320
prioritizing work.

268
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,700
John, you're exactly right.
Doesn't know the real value.

269
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,180
Ouch, that hurts. It's all about
which feature next product owns

270
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,260
the voice of the customer?
Right? Getting software built

271
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,860
faster? That was the winning
answer I wanted. Only product

272
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,380
management knows the answers. I
believe that but nobody else

273
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,220
believes it, right? Why do we
need you anyway, engineering

274
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,680
builds it, I'd love it. These
are all spot on?

275
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,630
Okay, so here's the three I
picked out. The first one, and I

276
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,130
think several of you said there,
right? That what we really need

277
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,210
is we need product engineering
to say yes to the sales side of

278
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,910
the house more often. And so
therefore what product

279
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,510
management product leadership
should be doing? Is whipping the

280
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,620
engineers harder, right? How do
we get more stuff out of the

281
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,300
development side of the house.

282
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,010
The second thing I run into a
lot is, oh, well, our products

283
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,510
really very complicated. And so
nobody can understand our

284
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,450
product unless they have at
least one or two advanced

285
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,990
degrees in our thing. So it's
not possible to hire any product

286
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,960
managers, unless they also
happen to have been at a famous

287
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,720
university with a thesis on our
stuff, right.

288
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,960
And then the third one, which I
think several of you had there

289
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,000
is the executive team has this
odd belief that our strategies

290
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,540
are so clear, and so aligned and
the OKRs is so well written,

291
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,530
that everybody's going to just
do the right thing and be on the

292
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,610
right page without much help.
And honestly, I think I've never

293
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,630
found this to be true.

294
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,120
So let's unpack these three,
just a little bit. And here we

295
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,040
go. So if anybody's at this
engineering organization, but

296
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,500
this is every engineering team
or development team I've ever

297
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,450
met, there is no development
team on the planet that isn't

298
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,580
already overloaded and has too
much to do 2x 5x 10x. Yet, the

299
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,460
executive team tells us that
what we really want is to push

300
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,910
harder, right? So the executive
team, the go to market team,

301
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,420
there's usually some hot issue
in their head, right? Just got

302
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,270
off a call with a customer. But
every dev team is

303
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,050
oversubscribed. And so we end up
in this ADHD model of

304
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,090
roadmapping. Where every 2.5
minutes, it turns out, we've got

305
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,420
a new strategy. And the failure
mode I see. In fact, I'm writing

306
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,540
a really long piece for one of
my clients on this is that we

307
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,930
have too many number one items.
And our answer when something's

308
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,590
important is to make another new
thing. Another top number one

309
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,920
items, so we constantly add, and
the team actually never finishes

310
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,730
anything. Right? So the
reputation that engineering gets

311
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,400
is that they're losers or
slackers are sitting around

312
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,690
eating bonbons, when the root
issue of course, is we've taken

313
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,540
on four times as much as we can,
and we're thrashing.

314
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,100
Right second of these, right,
only our special experts can

315
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,060
understand here's our product
manager unable to find her way

316
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,180
through the maze, because too
complicated. And I've taken

317
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,720
notes over the years. And the
winner I think was, Oh, our

318
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,890
company's doing six factor
authentication. And no one can

319
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,010
understand Understand six factor
authentication, unless they've

320
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,770
got at least one or two advanced
degrees in CES and

321
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,130
authentication. So there is no
product manager who's going to

322
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,910
understand this. Now, that's a
bit of a problem, not just for

323
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,010
the product manager, but
probably for the customers,

324
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,420
right? Because if we can't
explain it to a product manager,

325
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,290
then we probably can't sell it
to anybody. Right? And when we

326
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,800
hire a subject expert who's
never worn the product badge

327
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,270
before, here's what I see.

328
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,560
First of all, those subject
experts usually don't ever think

329
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,200
about the newbies, the
onboarding, the economics,

330
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,720
they're always thinking about
the two or three buddies of

331
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,160
theirs, who are the power high
end users, and they routinely

332
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,910
decide that their point of view
is so much more accurate than

333
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,800
what anything we're going to
learn from customers is of

334
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,640
course customers don't know what
they want that They put

335
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,670
themselves in the place of
already knowing all the answers

336
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,640
instead of going out and doing
what every good product person

337
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,270
does, which is endlessly,
repeatedly every single day,

338
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,240
talking to lots of users and
customers and prospects and

339
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,840
partners and lost deals, to find
out what's actually true in the

340
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,010
world. And my observation is, if
you give your newly arrived

341
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,740
Product Manager a couple of
months of halftime, send them

342
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,490
out on the road, have them do 20
or 30 customer meetings, they'll

343
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,790
come back understanding
everything they need. So this

344
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,600
idea is I think, fallacious,
it's just not true. But so many

345
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,860
places end up hiring a subject
expert who honestly couldn't

346
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,380
spell product, if you gave him
all the consonants in the

347
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,070
correct order.

348
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,570
And then my third one here,
here's our geese all lined up.

349
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,090
Here's our beautiful strategy.
everything's aligned, everybody

350
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,290
knows where we're going. The
first thing I find when

351
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,880
customers or companies adopt
OKRs, is they adopt first just

352
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,910
some revenue OKRs. Right, our
goal for the quarter is to make

353
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,140
20 million. And, you know, that
might suggest that I'm going to

354
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,530
sell off some my household
furniture for revenue or stand

355
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,230
on the corner in a very short
skirt, it's not a pretty sight.

356
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,570
When we try to, to figure out
how to apply that to product,

357
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,650
it's a zero help in figuring out
what's more important, or most

358
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,070
important, because we haven't
yet gotten down to target

359
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,830
audiences and positioning and
where we're going to win where

360
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,670
we're going to not win.

361
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,720
The other thing I see in these
organizations is that all the

362
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,100
OKRs are really functional level
ones. Finance has its goals.

363
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,820
Marketing has its goals, and
they simply don't ever touch.

364
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,500
Part of what we do is head of
product back to our sheepdog is,

365
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,090
I spent an awful lot of my time
trying to get my executive peers

366
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,800
to line up their their goals and
maybe measure the right thing. I

367
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,680
don't know if you've ever been
in a company where the support

368
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,680
team has a goal of shortening
their average call. And you know

369
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,310
what they do it. And the way
they do it is they throw folks

370
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,550
off the phone, and they don't
solve the problems. So those

371
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,580
people can call back, but the
average call is shorter. You

372
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,070
know, when we create goals, we
have to be really thoughtful,

373
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,100
because folks are going to do
just what we asked them paid

374
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,610
them to do.

375
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,940
Alright, so there's our three
misconceptions. Here's a sort of

376
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,760
takeaway thought for me, by the
way, I put a post up over the

377
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,690
weekend. That's the long form
text version of this. So anybody

378
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,290
who feels like they want to read
the 2000 words, just go to my

379
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,530
website, but he was the takeaway
from that, right? What are the

380
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,940
key skills, right? A lot of
negotiating a lot of empathy, a

381
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,330
lot of horse trading among the
internal stakeholders. But

382
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,540
somebody's got to stand up for
the real customers. I'm always

383
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,130
channeling the original Tron
movie from 1982, where they say,

384
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,240
we fight for the users, we don't
fight for the stakeholders, we

385
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,230
fight for the users.

386
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,840
Okay, so having done all that,
I'm going to flash past three

387
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,810
quick slides here. I'm not even
going to bother reading them

388
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,860
all. But I put together some
interview questions that when we

389
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,860
look at the videotape, or you
pull down the slide set, you

390
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,650
might want to borrow the next
time you're interviewing you had

391
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,160
a product. So instead of asking
how can we get more on the

392
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,810
roadmap? Here's a couple of
better questions, right? And

393
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,810
instead of how are you going to
get more productivity out of our

394
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:29,650
development team, whipping them
harder? Here's an alternative.

395
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,120
Right? Likewise, instead of
asking, Are you a subject

396
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,110
expert? Have you worked in our
exact tech segment and already

397
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,830
know what customers want? Wrong?
Here's a couple of ways you

398
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,630
might unpack that in an
interview.

399
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,940
And then one last one. I'm not a
fan of Net Promoter Score,

400
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,790
because it's pretty random and
doesn't give us much information

401
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:56,170
and it's easy to manipulate. So
here's a few better questions,

402
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,620
then NPS score to figure out how
we're going to understand what

403
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,980
our customers are doing. Okay, I
want to leave a lot of time for

404
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,810
questions. So let's go to a few
takeaways. Right? Got to have a

405
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,660
treat at the end. Everybody got
to the end. Here's your treat.

406
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,440
So here's our three things,
right. And if we were in the

407
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,890
hall together in Boston, I might
actually ask everybody to stand

408
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,340
up and repeat this. But I think
you can do that in the privacy

409
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,220
of your own desks here. Right?
Product management experience,

410
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,900
product leadership experience.
Before subject market technical

411
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,530
specifics, right? Please, Oh,
please, oh, please, don't bring

412
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,210
in somebody just because they
know your tech.

413
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,280
The thing we do, how do we add
value? Why do we care? Why does

414
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,610
anybody else care? It's because
often the product management

415
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,460
team and therefore the product
management leader, are the

416
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,790
people balancing long term
scratch strategy against current

417
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:55,150
quarter execution. And we are
endlessly battling the fight of

418
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,140
should we do this one special
little thing for this one big

419
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,430
customer who promises never to
ask us anything else again, at

420
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:07,180
least until later in the day? Or
are we going to let the entire

421
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,020
development team be diverted to
whatever three or four shiny

422
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,850
objects have come up in today's
sales calls? And then, you know,

423
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,210
what do we do leadership skills,
things we need, right? We need

424
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,290
to be able to keep the rest of
the executive team focused. not

425
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:23,860
trivial.

426
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,390
We need to keep our eyes on the
market success, the segments,

427
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,410
the larger picture, not single
accounts, we got to spend a

428
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,590
tremendous amount of time
understanding and loving all of

429
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,160
our peers across all the
organizations. And then last of

430
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,120
all, back to our puppy photo.
We've got to raise those young

431
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,650
uns, those soon to be product
managers, mentoring, tutoring,

432
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,290
teaching them how to do it,
cleaning up the carpet as

433
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,500
necessary. So that's the things
I think we're looking for in a

434
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,240
head of product. And I hope that
that helps us helps you with a

435
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,550
better frame around that. And
then just circling back to

436
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,040
Mark's point from the very
beginning, you could apply this

437
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,850
to any of your functions. I just
happen to tell it as a product

438
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,870
leadership story, because that's
my part of the problem. All

439
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,390
right, here's how to find me.
That's the website. That's the

440
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:16,300
email. That's the Twitter
handle. Anybody notice it's hard

441
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,980
to spell, but it's all the same?

442
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,150
Let's have a little round of
applause first.

443
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:31,600
I'll pick a few of these off the
chat, just start. Anybody wants

444
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,800
to break in with with the audio
later. So so lots of good

445
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,370
questions.

446
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,730
I'm going to start with with the
top one from from Brian: these

447
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,310
issues have existed since the
beginning of software product

448
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,990
businesses. Why is it so hard to
solve? I think part of it is

449
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,920
that most of what product
management does is sort of

450
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,160
transparent, right? When it's
working, you don't see it. And

451
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,580
when it's broken, you're usually
miss attributing it. So most of

452
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,600
the calls I get are from CEOs
who tell me their engineering

453
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,010
team doesn't work hard enough or
isn't productive or is lazy. And

454
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,940
then when we open the box, we
figure out that there's no goals

455
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,420
for the company, or they're in
complete conflict. And the CEO

456
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:18,160
comes down no more frequently
than let's say, every 25 minutes

457
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,710
to the development organization
with a new number one priority.

458
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,490
And they're dejected and
frustrated. And what they really

459
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,940
need more than anything else is
a product management team,

460
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,880
especially a head of product,
that's the semi permeable

461
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,540
membrane, the funnel, the
umbrella, such that the rest of

462
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,960
the company has to go through
something painful, before we can

463
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,510
interrupt what we've already
agreed to be in the sprint.

464
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,650
So that's not the obvious skill.
Everybody thinks about writing

465
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,460
user stories. Honestly, I don't
care about user stories, and I

466
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,330
don't care what format we have
them in. Turns out a

467
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,110
grammatically correct user story
is usually probably still the

468
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,510
wrong thing we should build.
It's not the grammar we want to

469
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,020
check. It's whether we did our
homework and truly understand

470
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:07,000
our customers, which is hard to
see. So the other thing, the

471
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,520
failure mode here is a lot of
folks have never been at a

472
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,240
company where product management
was any darn good. And so they

473
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,670
don't have a model in their head
what we're supposed to do.

474
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,530
Okay, good. Tim Burgess: How do
you build consensus or strength

475
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,740
of your voice when the other
executives are ostensibly more

476
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,990
important? or higher profile?

477
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,690
Really good question. I think of
every good product manager, as a

478
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,260
student of human behavior,
right? We've all read Dale

479
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,320
Carnegie's book from the 1920s,
about how to make friends and

480
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,410
influence people, we all
understand what the different

481
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,620
departments value and how
they're measured. We think a lot

482
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:49,870
about motivations and goals and
alignment. And so for instance,

483
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,260
the way I talk, the marketing
and sales side of the house,

484
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,380
through my roadmap, is entirely
different than the way I'd go

485
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,620
through it with my engineering
team. It's the same roadmap. But

486
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,340
on the sales side, we're almost
all talking about who it's for,

487
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,020
why they want it, and how can we
should be able to get full price

488
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,210
for it. Whereas on the
engineering side, we're talking

489
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,480
a lot more about the inner
workings of the problems we're

490
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,110
solving. So there's a lot of
channeling the different

491
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,170
audiences and what they need.
And then there's a tremendous

492
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,340
amount of honestly, horse
trading and alignment here.

493
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,330
Many of you know this, but every
single person in your support

494
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:32,950
organization expects to get 100%
of developments effort against

495
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,000
fixing bugs. And everybody in
your sales organization expects

496
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,230
engineering to spend 100% of
their effort on whatever these

497
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,280
new deals need. And your success
team wants 100% of their effort

498
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,640
against simpler workflows and
better onboarding. And your

499
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,970
engineering team wants to spend
80% on fixing your tech debt and

500
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,240
doing factoring. So there's
actually no way to get to a good

501
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,040
answer here. Unless we set up
some you know allocations in

502
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,250
agreements about how we're going
to work here. So I spend a lot

503
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,100
of my time trying to get
consensus on how we're going to

504
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,060
spend our general money before
we fall down the rabbit hole of

505
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,920
tickets. Okay.

506
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,900
David Carta: what order would
you hire people beyond founders,

507
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,030
CFO, product manager, VP sales.

508
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,440
That's a hard one. Because
usually the founders come from

509
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,670
some side, if they're
technologists, I probably want

510
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,570
to get maybe an early business
development person as opposed to

511
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,750
a salesperson. Because for the
first year, honestly, we don't

512
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,970
know what we're selling. And
we're going to have to take our

513
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,230
word back a few times, I usually
expect a company a startup to

514
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,790
hire its first full time product
manager, and about 12 people.

515
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,090
Because then by then you've got
a development team and

516
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,360
engineering team of six or
seven, that's enough to justify

517
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,690
a product manager, I don't
really see a head of product or

518
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:02,320
VP of product until we get to, I
don't know 3035. Because there's

519
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,530
just not enough scope there. If
I come in as the head of product

520
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,640
at a 12 person company, I have
to be also willing to do all the

521
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,510
individual contributor work,
which is fine, but not everybody

522
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,220
is willing to do that. Okay.

523
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,590
That's a great question from Go
ahead. And Mark Davis wants to

524
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,580
ask the CEO to validate they do
in fact, want to give up the

525
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,150
reins.

526
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,210
This is hard, because almost
every CEO will say yes to that.

527
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,110
Really no, right?

528
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,770
That's right, in practice, so
I'm not sure there's a question

529
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:44,770
I asked the CEO directly. Advice
I give to folks in every job: if

530
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,670
you're interviewing for a job at
a company is find some folks who

531
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,840
work at the company who are not
on the interview roster, get

532
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,540
into LinkedIn figured out who
you know, or who you're

533
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,590
connected, one hop away from. In
a better time, I would have said

534
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:03,550
take them out to breakfast. But
right now, it's virtual coffee,

535
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,180
and ask a lot of questions about
the company. Because first of

536
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,610
all, you want to learn about the
company before you get too far

537
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,660
in the interview cycle.

538
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,700
But a question I always ask or
some variation is, would you

539
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,260
recommend a good friend of yours
work at this company? Surprising

540
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,610
how often that answer is no. How
about did the CEO have a bad

541
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:29,140
childhood? Often? That's it.
Yes. Right? Well, what we're

542
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,140
looking we're looking for here
is somebody who's not

543
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,380
sufficiently biased by being in
the interview cycle, which means

544
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,010
they're trying to sell me on the
job and figure out if I'm

545
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,760
selling hard enough, but find
somebody whose objective is

546
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,650
going to tell you what's going
on, what are the company

547
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,130
problems? How are they doing?
Are there layoffs coming? Just

548
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:52,060
does this person get joy coming
into the office? Because I find

549
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,000
when you could answer get good
answers to that your CEO is most

550
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,150
likely doing a lot of the right
things. And there's a good

551
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,820
chance that that head of product
is going to be allowed to

552
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,830
succeed. I would say half the
time on those discussions. What

553
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:10,300
I hear back from people is, huh,
huh? Can we take that one

554
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,230
offline? And no, I wouldn't
recommend that my best friend

555
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,980
take a job here. Right? You
don't want to work there. Move

556
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,780
on. There's other jobs. Okay,
how about one other one? Should

557
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,520
I just pick one out? Or if
there's somebody who wants to

558
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,260
come in on audio? That would be
fun?

559
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,020
I think yeah, let's find someone
that wants to come in on audio.

560
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,310
So I find that in a lot of
companies, the head of product

561
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,940
means a lot of things. And
sometimes it's like, encroaching

562
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,450
across everything in the
company. And it's like owning

563
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,110
the customer. And I don't know
why. But so I just want to

564
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,800
clarify and have some opinion
from you. Like, what are the

565
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,160
what should be the
accountabilities of the head of

566
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,680
product or the accountabilities
of the product function?

567
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,100
Yeah, and this is hard, because
none of the things that Product

568
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,380
Management delivers are direct
customer consumables, right? And

569
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,590
products not actually in control
of any almost any of the

570
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,360
resources in the company. It's
hard to pin either success or

571
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,500
failure directly on product. So
I look for a lot of of secondary

572
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,890
things. Does everybody in the
company really understand what's

573
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,690
on the roadmap? Are we selling
to the right segments? Are we

574
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,840
mostly able to prop up our
prices and sell for something

575
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,480
near list price? A good
secondary thing is that sales

576
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,040
doesn't hate engineering. And
engineering doesn't hate sales.

577
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,950
Because by the way, if that's
the case, product either can't

578
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:45,430
succeed, or has failed
miserably, right. So notice,

579
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,640
those are all sort of
interstitial things. Do we have

580
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,060
a product strategy that we stick
to? Again, you can knock that

581
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,420
down from almost any department,
but if product succeeding those

582
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,720
are things that everybody
immediately says yes to. And so

583
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,220
the head of product is as much
intent internal salesperson for

584
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,220
clarity and strategy and
segmentation in targeting and

585
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,900
staying on focus as anything
else. Thanks. Sure.

586
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,040
So Peldi asked a question, which
was skelding. Any tips for

587
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,820
founders, CEOs to delegate Head
of Product responsibilities?

588
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,720
Probably being unusually shy
today?

589
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,480
Yeah. I don't know why Peldi.
But I think the that is the

590
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,020
right question, which is, can I
feel comfortable enough

591
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,410
delegating to the head of
product. And generally, the

592
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,960
failure mode here is around the
CEO believing that they are in

593
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,030
fact sampling the customer base
adequately, and that I know what

594
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,150
customers want, because I'm
talking to a lot of customers.

595
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,200
And the reason that doesn't hold
up is because at least at this

596
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,290
stage, almost all the
conversations that the CEO is

597
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,470
having with customers are
pushed, they're selling, they're

598
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:03,550
trying to get somebody to agree.
And what you do when you listen

599
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:07,090
to those calls with the CEO is
you find out the CEO is talking

600
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:12,010
70% or 80% of the time, which is
a sales call. And the folks at

601
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:14,590
the other end are either
politely listening or raising

602
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,500
small objections. But they're
not really saying what they

603
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,790
think the other thing that CEOs
and founders get is they get the

604
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,890
rapid escalations from the few
large customers of random things

605
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,310
they're unhappy about. And so
they decide that all customers

606
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,130
are having this problem, because
they're sampling badly, right.

607
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,730
And so, as a head of product,
what I need is some agreement

608
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:41,740
from the CEO, that if I can show
data, if my team is interviewing

609
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,670
40 customers a month or 90
customers a month, that we're

610
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:50,050
going to get believed that when
we identify that 65% of the

611
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,950
customers have an issue, but
it's not the one that CEO heard

612
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,400
about this morning, that we're
gonna get a hearing on that and

613
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,240
facts matter. And that's really
hard emotionally for the CEO,

614
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,780
because, you know, we're all the
center of our universes. And we

615
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:10,450
believe that what we're seeing
is a you know, an effective and

616
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,980
well sampled pattern.

617
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,870
Okay, I'm gonna pick one more,
Tim, we got from Tim, how about

618
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,020
Elizabeth Aveda: when should a
company hire it's first product

619
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,000
manager? I think we touched
that, you know, again, I'm

620
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,660
thinking like 12 employees, 14
employees.

621
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,720
Let's see what we got. Igor
says: In what form is

622
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,180
understanding the customer
captured? Is it just in a

623
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,510
product managers head, this is a
really hard problem, because

624
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,470
it's rather unstructured. One of
the ways I coach my heads of

625
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,370
product and product managers is,
first of all, every time we

626
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:53,150
interview a customer, assuming
it's not a sales call, I want to

627
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,930
include on the call a designer
and developer. Now, they

628
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,950
probably don't talk, I run the
interview. But it's very clear,

629
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,740
they hear different things than
I do, and they listen for

630
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,730
different things.

631
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,360
And we usually have some regime
where either they write me a

632
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,630
post it note, or they drop me a
Slack message on the side for

633
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,050
questions I'm missing, right, we
might have an hour's

634
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,710
conversation with a customer. So
we're going to capture that

635
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,660
we're gonna record it with
permission, of course, don't

636
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,210
want to break the law, we're
going to put that in a

637
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,110
repository. But right next to
it. At the very end of the call,

638
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,530
as soon as we're done before it
falls out of our heads, we're

639
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,460
going to among ourselves, pick
the three or four or five

640
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,450
takeaways, lessons, interesting
things, put them in bullets at

641
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,470
the very top, and send around to
the rest of the company, the

642
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,130
three bullets and a link to the
recording. That's important

643
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,980
because we do it right away. So
a recency bias isn't going to

644
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,280
get us in trouble. It helps
because the rest of the company

645
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,910
starts to notice that the
product team actually talks to

646
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,410
customers all the time.

647
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,890
And then, in general, I find
that we don't know the right

648
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:05,180
questions until 10 interviews in
or 15 interviews and we have to

649
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,750
go back and read our notes.
Because something popped up in

650
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,950
five of those conversations,
that was so bizarre, that we

651
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,170
never even thought to ask and
we're going to go back to our

652
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,350
notes back to our recordings,
and figure out if it was a

653
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,770
pattern. So that's a way that we
can share them out, get this

654
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,560
summary to the rest of the
world. And anybody who needs to

655
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,510
dig deep configure out which
transcript or recording is going

656
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,190
to have the detailed stuff in
it.

657
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,870
Hey, thanks for just a great
talk and answering so many

658
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,730
questions generously. I was
wondering if you could talk a

659
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,180
little bit more about the
smokejumper role and outside the

660
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,200
context of just fighting a
burning fire but also like as a

661
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,880
transition or even alternative
to hiring a full time w two

662
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,420
executive.

663
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,500
Yeah, so I've done about a dozen
of those. And every time I

664
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,910
promised myself not to do it
again. Because honestly, they're

665
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,700
they're really hard and
irrationally painful. And it

666
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,830
does borrow from the firefighter
terminology because the, the

667
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,380
smoke jumpers are the ones who
are parachuted on the far side

668
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,620
of the fire, to knock down all
the fuel, and they don't get to

669
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,620
go home, smelly and tired and
smoky until they fought their

670
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:21,080
way back through the fire. I
don't advise anyone to do this,

671
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,680
if they have a choice. You're
bringing in an outsider who

672
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,350
doesn't know the company and
doesn't know the product, I'm

673
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,290
generally much more effective in
that first quarter, or quarter

674
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,350
and a half. And fixing
organizational issues, and

675
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:37,250
process issues and goal issues,
I'm never gonna be smart enough

676
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,120
about your product in three
months, to really have strong

677
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,400
opinions about the product
details.

678
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:48,140
So generally, I'm called in when
it's really broken. And I want

679
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,480
to leave as soon as possible.
And the company wants me to help

680
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,950
them hiring a replacement as
soon as possible. Because every

681
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,950
company deserves a full time
head of product, who has the

682
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,090
long term understands the trade
offs, loves the customers with

683
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:06,230
all their heart and soul, and
understands how to move the

684
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,380
other executive players around
the board. So we get the right

685
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,830
things built and shipped. And
that's a lot of internal

686
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,930
discovery. It's a lot of
relationship building.

687
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,830
The one dirty secret here, which
since we're recording

688
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:22,910
everybody's going to know is as
the interim, here's here's my

689
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,120
other office manager, by the
way, as the interim head of

690
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,330
product, I can say and do things
that no full time employee would

691
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:34,100
ever say or do. I can be as
blunt with the CEO and pull them

692
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,710
aside for coaching about things
that you would never do if you

693
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,950
want to keep your job, because
I'm leaving anyway. And there's

694
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,670
no stock options for me. And
there's no bonus for me. My job

695
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,120
is to clean it up and get the
heck out. And so I have a lot

696
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,080
more freedom of movement. But
for a limited time, because you

697
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,020
don't get away with that for
more than a quarter or two. And

698
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,010
I'm usually burned out by then
anyway, so time to go home. I

699
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:01,640
can't I can't tell you that
that's something you would love.

700
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,220
But it's strong medicine when
you need it.

701
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,390
Well, that was actually a reason
for picking on picking on Jeff.

702
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:21,320
He asked that question earlier
on about relative roles, or

703
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,690
roles of head of product versus
some of the other bits of the

704
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,730
team. Jeff, do you want to
speak?

705
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,260
The question that Tomas asked in
rich well answered to pretty

706
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,400
much covered the majority of
that, like from the standpoint

707
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,850
that? Yeah, I think there's this
really interesting thing where

708
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,400
this sort of there's these
accountabilities, probably the

709
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,270
the product team typically has
that there is responsibilities

710
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,910
are tough to fall through. And,
again, I thought rich painted it

711
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,620
really well. Maybe the only
thing I would add, there was the

712
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,200
other nuance was, yeah, if we
were just complete a more

713
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,810
organizational picture. And that
same sort of vein, what then is

714
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,630
the accountabilities of, say
engineering and maybe marketing

715
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,690
in this role of figuring out the
product. Conversely, to it Rich

716
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,730
said, because there's this
interesting trend, where some

717
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,010
people have talked about how
product management is a

718
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,890
separate, not as a role. It's
obviously a very important role

719
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,290
in the company to, to focus on
these accountabilities. But

720
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,280
that, as a separate vertical
department in a company is a

721
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,030
could be a little problematic.
In other words, why isn't

722
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,340
product considered part of the
engineering organization, for

723
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,620
example, an organization right.

724
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,560
And the challenge, if you have a
13 person company, you can't

725
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,700
have I mean, 13 departments, but
I observe that the engineering

726
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,020
team is really measured and
rewarded by getting things done.

727
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,320
But they're not measured and
rewarded for getting the right

728
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,620
things done. And it's not their
competency to make that call.

729
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:50,330
And on the marketing side, in a
good company, we've got a

730
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,000
product focus one. And so
marketing is really focusing on

731
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,800
the outbound positioning and
segmentation, and nurturing and

732
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,740
all the things that are that are
core to marketing. In general,

733
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,030
the marketing folks are a little
lightweight in terms of product

734
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,930
knowledge and internals. When we
have marketing folks spec out

735
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,560
products, we have really good
UX, but nothing under the hood,

736
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,290
soy, soy products sort of
halfway between. But in every

737
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,810
organization, we draw the line
in a different place. There's no

738
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:22,400
perfect, and it's so much about
how the different execs are

739
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,940
going to divide up the world
where they are the work in a way

740
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,200
that everybody can get along and
the fistfights in the alleys or

741
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,720
the the aisles of the office are
minimized. One last thought and

742
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,440
then I'll close.

743
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,360
We've got a few more questions.
Emily. Emily, could you just say

744
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:41,990
something.

745
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:50,360
I don't reload because people
get distracted but yeah, there

746
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,200
we go. That's my background
everybody. Self esteem boost for

747
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:54,590
the day.

748
00:44:55,610 --> 00:45:00,020
For Emily, there's a couple of
questions and then quite a few

749
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,380
You're different people asking
about early stage companies,

750
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:09,290
Nick mer or Ben Ebong. Do you
want to pipe up and talk about

751
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,300
pm and roles and
responsibilities?

752
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:17,570
Yeah, hey, guys. Hey, rich, I
think you mentioned when you

753
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:23,450
should invest in a PLM,
essentially around a 12 person

754
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,030
team when you get to that stage,
but what happens if you're

755
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,900
trying to get to that stage? Who
should be tackling those roles

756
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,440
and responsibilities? And how do
you do that effectively? Maybe

757
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,600
you're a Product Manager and
CEO, maybe you're not.

758
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:42,470
It's a real challenge. Yeah. And
I'm not I'm seeing more true

759
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,230
startups two, and three and five
person startups where one of

760
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:50,120
those folks is, in fact, at
heart, a product manager. And I

761
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,800
think that gets us along the
discovery or validation track

762
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,230
really fast, I just don't see
most companies being able to

763
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:03,260
afford it. Right. So and that
person's even, even if they're

764
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:06,470
100% product originally, they're
probably doing three other jobs,

765
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,720
right? At a startup, we're all
doing a bunch of jobs.

766
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,530
So what I'd say is, I think it's
really, really important or

767
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,350
useful for a startup to have
somebody who's got product

768
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,680
management experience. But I'm
not sure at a four person

769
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,100
company that we're going to have
anybody whose sole job and name

770
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,550
tag says Product Management
because there's, there's not

771
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,950
enough division of labor in a
company that size.

772
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,380
I was just gonna pick something
up because Kevin Davis had a

773
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,720
good comment here, full
disclosure had been fired more

774
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,480
than once in this failure mode.
I've got to tell you, I've been

775
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,670
fired more than once in this
failure mode, too. So only, you

776
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:44,690
know, a handful of times, but it
was very instructive and good to

777
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:47,540
deflate my ego from where I
thought it was. Okay, I'm sorry,

778
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,010
Mark, you were going to take us
somewhere else?

779
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,460
Yeah, I was just gonna ask John
Saltz, if he wants to talk about

780
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,180
where product marketing should
fit.

781
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,520
Yes. You mentioned the marketing
sort of spectrum between

782
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,010
marketing and product
management. I'm wondering

783
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,520
product marketing. Yeah, big
enough where you need product

784
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,460
marketing, which we're big
enough, right? Yeah. It's more

785
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,550
of knowing the products and then
doing the marketing function.

786
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,570
What do you think about that?

787
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:21,020
I think, it's a hard call,
right. So when there's enough

788
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,210
product marketers, or enough
product marketing to have a

789
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,970
department, right, the two
choices one is to have it report

790
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:30,380
to marketing. And often the
product marketers feel a little

791
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,520
unloved and left out, because
they're doing something, you

792
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,910
know, somewhat more intellectual
is maybe a strong word, but it's

793
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:42,710
more content driven, it's more
subjective. It's very closely

794
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:47,450
tied to sales. And often the
product marketers feel unloved

795
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:52,010
by the demand gen side of the
house. But it's one of the two

796
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:55,340
choices. And at least, we know
that when we bring out a new

797
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,770
product, they'll be some
campaigns behind it, because

798
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,600
they're in the same
organization. And the messaging

799
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,680
will be good when we move it
under the head of product,

800
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,950
because sometimes I see product
marketing as part of the product

801
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,390
team next to product management.

802
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:12,140
What we've done is on the
positive side, we're getting a

803
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,350
lot better communications
between the product marketers

804
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,900
and the product managers were
much more likely to describe the

805
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,870
products correctly, to know who
they're for to have that stuff.

806
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,770
But often what we've lost is the
really tight connection to the

807
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:28,760
rest of marketing. So there's
this pendulum effect. Sometimes

808
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,820
I see where we have product
marketing on the marketing side

809
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,750
for 15 months, and then we
decide it would be better on the

810
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,560
product side for 15 months, and
then we think it would be better

811
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,100
on the marketing side for 15
months. And those folks get a

812
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:49,250
little whiplash. But, you know,
I think all product folks figure

813
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,910
out that we have to fill the gap
that the organization creates.

814
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,600
So no matter how we divide
people up, there are natural

815
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,710
gaps. And as the product folks,
we have to see those we have to

816
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:05,210
reach across we have to be
triply quadruple ly pushy about

817
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,970
communicating and loving the
folks across the gap because

818
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,470
everybody is across the aisle
from us. And, you know, we're

819
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:18,410
always papering over whatever
division we created. To non

820
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:19,700
answer, but it's my answer.

821
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,970
Right, Patrick Quinn, who
traditionally if he doesn't ask

822
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:37,370
a number of questions at any BoS
Conference. Isn't really at the

823
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:41,900
conference. Patrick, you've got
a question about experience

824
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:42,740
knowledge.

825
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,450
And and it looks like that's
about Scrum and Agile. So I'll

826
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:51,980
pick up Patrick's question. So I
think it's essential. I think

827
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,830
it's required that product
managers really understand how

828
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:59,300
their software is built. I think
there's no excuse for that. And

829
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,950
so we have to be agile
practitioners, right? We and but

830
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:07,010
in the broad sense, not in
honest again, I don't care if

831
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,980
you're Kanban or Scrum or
halfway in between your XP,

832
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,440
you're right. I've been at this
game so long that I know that

833
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,670
those are all right solutions
for some situations, I don't

834
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:19,850
think the product folks get to
be dogmatic about how the

835
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,670
software is built. It's not
their call. But we have to know

836
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:26,600
where we fit in. And probably
three places where it's really

837
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,860
important one is, we have to get
our problem statements or

838
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,380
whatever they are in the right
format. So our engineers and

839
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,170
developers are actually going to
engage with them. Notice, I

840
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,570
didn't say solutions, I said
problems, right.

841
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,130
The second is, I think we need
to be in every retrospective,

842
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,700
because so many of the issues
that come up on our development

843
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,350
teams are out of scope for the
developers themselves, right?

844
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:54,620
They can't fix organizational
problems, they can't fix lack of

845
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,310
focus on the sales side. They
can't fix weird, you know,

846
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:01,940
things that marketing's doing,
and and so my product managers

847
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,120
and I show up to the
retrospectives. So we take

848
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,500
assignments out of that to go
fix things, or lobby folks who

849
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,800
are outside the development team
that are blocking things for

850
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,790
development, right.

851
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,380
And then the third one is, we as
product folks are the semi

852
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,560
permeable shields were the
blockers to everybody who wants

853
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,440
to interrupt the current sprint,
I was just working with somebody

854
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,180
yesterday. And we defined the
conditions under which somebody

855
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,140
else in the company can break
the sprint, and it is the list

856
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:38,210
of one and it is p zero system
down. Customers can't use our

857
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:43,160
software, right? If our cloud is
offline, if our users can't log

858
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,860
in or enter data, we all stop
what we're doing, and we get it

859
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,670
fixed. But anything other than
that product managers have to

860
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:53,120
throw their bodies in the way of
all the other interrupts there's

861
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:56,480
nothing so important that we
can't wait a half a week until

862
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,040
the next sprint starts. And so
we have to live the Agile story,

863
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,580
we have to be part of the Agile
story. But I don't actually care

864
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,700
about the details that happen,
you know that the inside

865
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,330
baseball inside the sprint,
other than that the team's

866
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:17,240
working and I can help them. So
there's an outer loop, agile

867
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,510
here, as opposed to the inner
loop agile of single story

868
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:23,780
single points. Right? How do we
support agile as an

869
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,040
organization's organization?
Awesome. Thank you. Cool.

870
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:32,570
All right. Ben McDonald. So what
are your thoughts on pragmatic

871
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,250
marketing framework? But let's
extend that I mean, the almost

872
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,990
infinite number of frameworks.

873
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:42,050
Yeah. And for everything, I
guess, and I know, the pragmatic

874
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:44,510
folks are really smart, and
they're helping educate up the

875
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,750
product, folks, here's my
observation. There are, I don't

876
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,050
know, maybe no more than a dozen
or two different frameworks for

877
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:56,540
product management, they are all
morally the same. You know, you

878
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,730
need to have your own framework,
if you're going to put it on

879
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,520
your logo and promote it and
sell books and put people

880
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,140
through your class. But I've
never actually found anybody who

881
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:11,210
directly implements any of them
as written. So first of all,

882
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,780
they're just boxes on a page
with some templates. Going to a

883
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,020
class for two days does not
teach you how to be a product

884
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:18,470
manager.

885
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:22,460
My good friend Scott Sal Horst
out of Austin taught me that a

886
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,850
weekend at the dude ranch
doesn't make you a cowboy.

887
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:31,460
Right. And so it's true mark,
sorry. So I know that I want to

888
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:34,400
send my folks off maybe to a
class or two, because we're

889
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,520
gonna get a common vocabulary,
and we're gonna maybe have some

890
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,540
common templates, you know, get
on the same tools. But none of

891
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,600
that is the essence of product
management, the essence of

892
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,860
product management is embroiling
yourself in lots of customer

893
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,740
issues, and really, really,
really deeply understanding and

894
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,280
empathizing with what they need.
And then bringing that stuff

895
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,970
back to your development team,
where the much smarter folks are

896
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,570
going to help you figure out how
to solve it. And the workflows

897
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,840
are useful. But every time we
come to a new company, we blow

898
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,670
up those workflows and start
some new ones.

899
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,620
So I wouldn't confuse the grid
or the matrix or the flow

900
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,280
through diagram. With the
essential content. It's the same

901
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,280
problem as I don't know if you
guys know this, but writing a

902
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,990
book is just a matter of putting
100,000 words in a file. Now,

903
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,730
writing a good book is putting
the correct 100,000 words in the

904
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:33,440
file. And it's easy to get
confused between I showed up I

905
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,310
was in a meeting, I wrote a user
story and anything of value. So,

906
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,160
you know, let's just be cautious
about how much you can learn in

907
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,050
two days of a survey course,
rather than two years of living

908
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:48,470
with your mistakes by staying on
the same product long enough

909
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:49,670
that they all come back to bite
you.

910
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:57,620
Amazing. One last question. If
someone's got something rich,

911
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,860
you rattle through these so
quickly. Alright. I rattled.

912
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,140
Let's don't apologize.

913
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:07,130
Alright, so I have, I have one
last thought here, which, for

914
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,160
those of you who thought this
was going to be something you

915
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,240
wanted to emulate, right?
Whenever anybody comes up to me

916
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,970
and says they think they might
want to become a product

917
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:20,750
manager, or even worse, a
product leader, I think it's my

918
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:24,800
obligation spend the next 10 or
15 minutes, arguing the other

919
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,790
side. It's a, it's a
fascinating, wonderful, narrow

920
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:32,150
position. Most folks don't want
it most folks don't succeed at

921
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:36,020
it. It's not that much fun. I
observed that really smart folks

922
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:39,110
do product management for a few
years, and then something more

923
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:43,040
rewarding. And that's only
useful if I can tell you I

924
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,170
wasn't so smart because I've
been in product management for

925
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:55,220
30 plus years. So II OMEOJ
Whatever. Oh, nobody's old

926
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,820
enough. And anybody tell me what
the last punch card in the stack

927
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:05,180
says. And that's only useful
because each time I've been

928
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:09,410
fired, the three letters I write
on my whiteboard on my way out R

929
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,710
E. O. J. I put an away message
you said 404. Vice President not

930
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:22,460
found Nice. Okay. Great. Thanks
for everybody's attention. And

931
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,650
for Mark and the team for
letting me come play
