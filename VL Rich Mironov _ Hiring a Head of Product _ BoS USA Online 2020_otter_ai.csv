hour, but we're going to chop it"
"2","00:00:12:23","00:00:17:19","down and speed it up and keep
the back half hour for q&a as we"
"3","00:00:17:19","00:00:20:16","go. Great. So we're gonna talk
about hiring a head of product."
"4","00:00:20:16","00:00:24:01","And as Mark said, I think this
is really a general topic. But"
"5","00:00:24:01","00:00:27:22","because I'm a pure software
product management guy, I'm"
"6","00:00:27:22","00:00:31:15","telling it from my side of the
story. So, you know, we'll be"
"7","00:00:31:15","00:00:34:19","able to generalize quite a bit,
but we'll take it from that"
"8","00:00:34:19","00:00:35:07","point of view."
"9","00:00:36:02","00:00:40:09","Okay, just a very brief
introduction for me. Quick hint,"
"10","00:00:40:10","00:00:44:21","I'm on the right in this photo.
On the left is my other office"
"11","00:00:44:21","00:00:48:06","manager, Celeste, Olivia may
join us as you saw during the"
"12","00:00:48:06","00:00:52:10","warm up. So what's important
about this for the talk is to"
"13","00:00:52:10","00:00:56:09","set up why I think I might have
something to say about it. I'm a"
"14","00:00:56:09","00:01:01:13","30 plus year veteran of Silicon
Valley b2b enterprise software."
"15","00:01:01:13","00:01:04:23","So I had my first product
management job in the late 80s."
"16","00:01:04:24","00:01:07:24","It's not a new thing. And these
days, I'm spending a lot of my"
"17","00:01:07:24","00:01:11:06","time helping software companies
design their product"
"18","00:01:11:06","00:01:16:04","organizations, coaching their
product leaders. And then you"
"19","00:01:16:04","00:01:18:22","know, the statistic that's
probably important here. So in"
"20","00:01:18:22","00:01:23:05","the last 19 years, since I went
solo, I've done about 150"
"21","00:01:23:05","00:01:26:18","engagements with different
clients, of which a dozen are"
"22","00:01:26:18","00:01:30:05","what we've called the
smokejumper, VP product jobs. So"
"23","00:01:30:05","00:01:33:06","that's where I come into a
company as the interim or"
"24","00:01:33:06","00:01:36:15","temporary head of product for
usually a couple of quarters and"
"25","00:01:36:15","00:01:39:20","get everything straightened out.
I've also done a little over a"
"26","00:01:39:20","00:01:44:05","dozen assistance roles where I
help my clients figure out who"
"27","00:01:44:05","00:01:46:15","they need as head of product,
and then interview the"
"28","00:01:46:15","00:01:51:04","candidates and be part of the
the assessment team, which is"
"29","00:01:51:04","00:01:53:15","really where this is coming out.
So having done a few dozen of"
"30","00:01:53:15","00:01:57:12","these, I may be, you know, more
frequently in this role than"
"31","00:01:57:12","00:02:00:18","anyone else on the planet other
than folks who are in the search"
"32","00:02:00:18","00:02:01:14","business themselves."
"33","00:02:01:14","00:02:05:02","So I've tried to pull together
some observations that might be"
"34","00:02:05:02","00:02:07:24","useful for us, you know, of
course in the narrow: how do we"
"35","00:02:07:24","00:02:11:21","hire head of product? And in the
broader: How do we apply lessons"
"36","00:02:11:21","00:02:13:03","to some of the other
departments?"
"37","00:02:13:21","00:02:18:21","Okay, let's jump in. The first
challenge I think we have is,"
"38","00:02:19:03","00:02:21:22","nobody seems to know what to
call this job. So here's our"
"39","00:02:22:07","00:02:26:23","caped crusader hero, we don't
know this dog's name. But what I"
"40","00:02:26:23","00:02:30:20","observe is that I'm going to use
the phrase head of product, H O,"
"41","00:02:30:20","00:02:33:10","P, because we need to call it
something. And I'm going to"
"42","00:02:33:10","00:02:38:08","specifically say that what we're
talking about is folks who"
"43","00:02:38:08","00:02:41:23","manage product managers. Again,
this would seem obvious, most of"
"44","00:02:41:23","00:02:43:24","this is obvious, but I'm
discovering that it's not."
"45","00:02:44:05","00:02:47:01","Sometimes we call those folks
Chief Product Officer, VP,"
"46","00:02:47:01","00:02:49:05","Product Director, product,
group, product, lead, whatever,"
"47","00:02:49:05","00:02:53:05","whatever. And this person might
also have, I don't know, a"
"48","00:02:53:05","00:02:57:05","couple of designers, there might
be a market research person or"
"49","00:02:57:05","00:03:01:23","whatever. But I'm specifically
going to not talk about folks"
"50","00:03:02:00","00:03:04:19","who are mostly running
development or engineering"
"51","00:03:04:19","00:03:07:17","teams. So there's lots of the
piece of product out there with"
"52","00:03:07:17","00:03:12:01","many different names CIO, CTO,
General Manager, I observed that"
"53","00:03:12:02","00:03:17:13","if you are managing, let's say,
85 developers, and for product"
"54","00:03:17:13","00:03:20:17","managers, most of your brain is
on the development side of the"
"55","00:03:20:17","00:03:23:10","house, not the product side of
the house. So I'm going to not"
"56","00:03:23:10","00:03:26:08","include those folks in our
little breakdown here."
"57","00:03:28:06","00:03:33:06","Okay, here's our little bad dog.
And, and a few of the failures"
"58","00:03:33:06","00:03:36:22","that I see over and over again,
as we say, you know, what are"
"59","00:03:36:22","00:03:41:09","the primary failures that either
I'm called in to fix, or I'm"
"60","00:03:41:15","00:03:45:00","stuck on the side of the road
watching the accidents for, and"
"61","00:03:45:00","00:03:45:01","The first one, which is maybe
where we're gonna spend most of"
"62","00:03:45:01","00:03:45:16","there's really three."
"63","00:03:49:05","00:03:54:02","our time for the next 40
minutes, is companies that hire"
"64","00:03:54:02","00:03:56:24","somebody to be the head of
product, who's neither led a"
"65","00:03:56:24","00:04:00:02","product team, nor been a product
manager, this is a head"
"66","00:04:00:02","00:04:02:12","scratcher for me, but we'll
break it down a little bit."
"67","00:04:02:23","00:04:07:02","The second failure mode I see
is, if you're the first product"
"68","00:04:07:02","00:04:10:00","person in the door at a startup,
or the first head of product at"
"69","00:04:10:00","00:04:13:21","a startup, it's pretty rare for
the founders to actually give up"
"70","00:04:13:21","00:04:17:08","the autonomy and control that
they need for you to succeed,"
"71","00:04:17:15","00:04:21:05","even though they say they do.
And so I see the duration of"
"72","00:04:21:05","00:04:24:20","that first head of product being
pretty short. The acronym"
"73","00:04:24:20","00:04:29:03","sometimes we use his MTBE,
meantime between executives."
"74","00:04:29:18","00:04:32:19","And then the third thing that
really contributes I think to"
"75","00:04:32:19","00:04:36:12","what we're going to see is that
many of the folks at software"
"76","00:04:36:12","00:04:39:08","companies who lead software
companies who found companies"
"77","00:04:39:12","00:04:43:06","don't actually understand what
product management does. And so"
"78","00:04:43:06","00:04:46:00","they've got some real
misapprehensions or confusion"
"79","00:04:46:07","00:04:48:18","around what it is that they need
and have a product."
"80","00:04:50:04","00:04:53:18","Okay, so because I don't want to
be talking the whole time, we're"
"81","00:04:53:18","00:04:57:19","going to do a little experiment
here. We're going to try a bit"
"82","00:04:57:19","00:05:01:13","of a tweetstorm. So if I can ask
get everybody to open up their"
"83","00:05:01:13","00:05:04:22","chat box. And here's the
question I want you to ask,"
"84","00:05:04:22","00:05:07:13","don't hit return yet. So type in
your answer, and then we'll all"
"85","00:05:07:13","00:05:10:20","hit it at once. So we can all
see it at once. If you are going"
"86","00:05:10:20","00:05:15:06","to be interviewing somebody as
your new potential VP of sales"
"87","00:05:15:06","00:05:18:13","or Chief Revenue Officer, what's
the first question or two, you"
"88","00:05:18:13","00:05:22:22","would want to ask them? I'll
give everybody a minute. And"
"89","00:05:22:22","00:05:28:02","then count to three, count to
four, count to five. All right,"
"90","00:05:28:02","00:05:31:01","when you have an answer, hit
Return, and I'll pick a few of"
"91","00:05:31:01","00:05:34:09","them out of here. Okay, that's
right."
"92","00:05:34:10","00:05:37:08","Tell me about your first sales
job. How do you increase sales?"
"93","00:05:37:13","00:05:40:12","What's your sales strategy?
What's your sales process?"
"94","00:05:40:12","00:05:43:03","Excellent. How much revenue did
you earn last year? What was"
"95","00:05:43:03","00:05:43:19","your quota?"
"96","00:05:44:18","00:05:49:13","So those are all questions that
would suggest that we'd really"
"97","00:05:49:13","00:05:52:01","like to have somebody as our VP
of sales or chief revenue"
"98","00:05:52:01","00:05:55:09","officer who has been a
salesperson and maybe lead"
"99","00:05:55:10","00:05:58:00","salespeople. Because it turns
out there's a lot of art and"
"100","00:05:58:00","00:06:00:21","science. Yes, I do know Paul
Kenny, and I think he's"
"101","00:06:00:21","00:06:05:15","brilliant. And I rarely see a
company that hires a head of"
"102","00:06:05:15","00:06:08:08","sales who has not been in sales
before, although, in full"
"103","00:06:08:08","00:06:11:17","disclosure, one of my clients
had somebody running sales who's"
"104","00:06:11:17","00:06:14:18","really a finance guy from m&a.
And that's a lot more"
"105","00:06:14:18","00:06:18:08","challenging. Likewise, if we're
going to hire somebody, as our"
"106","00:06:18:08","00:06:20:19","Chief Financial Officer, we'd
really like to know that they"
"107","00:06:20:19","00:06:25:01","understand payroll, and how to
run an accounts payable or"
"108","00:06:25:01","00:06:29:01","receivables group, how to keep
our executives out of jail by"
"109","00:06:29:01","00:06:32:00","not running out of money. If
we're gonna hire somebody who's"
"110","00:06:32:00","00:06:35:18","a VP of engineering or a CTO, we
might, for instance, want them"
"111","00:06:35:18","00:06:39:04","to have built software before
that would be really handy."
"112","00:06:39:11","00:06:43:01","Maybe even run a software team
or two, because if we dropped"
"113","00:06:43:01","00:06:45:23","somebody in his VP of
engineering, who thinks that"
"114","00:06:45:23","00:06:49:13","software is neat, and might like
to build some, someday, we've"
"115","00:06:49:13","00:06:53:06","got a lot of hurt on our hands.
Again, it would seem obvious,"
"116","00:06:53:06","00:06:57:03","but what I noticed over and over
again, and it's Tuesday, I had"
"117","00:06:57:03","00:07:01:16","this discussion twice yesterday
with some of my clients were at"
"118","00:07:01:16","00:07:04:22","the very, very top in the very
first position of the"
"119","00:07:04:22","00:07:08:09","requirements for this job of
head of product, what we don't"
"120","00:07:08:09","00:07:15:06","find is, in a product manager,
run a product team. Okay, so"
"121","00:07:15:10","00:07:18:13","let's, let's get back to our
animals just a little bit and"
"122","00:07:18:14","00:07:21:17","consider some different animals
we might want for this job."
"123","00:07:22:24","00:07:27:08","All right. Certainly here,
here's my ideal candidate for"
"124","00:07:27:08","00:07:29:17","the head of product, you'll
notice this Australian Shepherd"
"125","00:07:29:17","00:07:33:20","is going to move the sheep
along. Everything about this"
"126","00:07:33:20","00:07:35:24","head of product job,
particularly at a startup that's"
"127","00:07:35:24","00:07:39:09","trying to find its way is
thinking about the market and"
"128","00:07:39:09","00:07:42:13","the segments, not the
individual, not the one sheep,"
"129","00:07:42:21","00:07:45:17","we've got to move the whole herd
to wherever the water is,"
"130","00:07:46:00","00:07:48:23","instead of letting them wander
in all directions. Do we have a"
"131","00:07:48:23","00:07:52:07","clear strategy? Is it tied to
what our development team is"
"132","00:07:52:07","00:07:55:13","going to do? We're going to
measure outcomes, can we move"
"133","00:07:55:13","00:07:59:12","the whole company along toward
our product goal and our revenue"
"134","00:07:59:12","00:08:03:24","goal. An important useful fact
here is that nobody works for"
"135","00:08:03:24","00:08:06:23","product management, we've got
lots of responsibility and"
"136","00:08:06:24","00:08:10:19","absolutely no authority. So
other than nipping at our heels"
"137","00:08:10:19","00:08:14:16","and moving people along, you
know, not many sticks to"
"138","00:08:14:18","00:08:18:06","swinging there. And a lot of it
is about long term thinking, if"
"139","00:08:18:06","00:08:20:22","we're going to get the whole
company toward a strategic"
"140","00:08:20:22","00:08:23:17","outcome, we're all going to have
to work together, we're going to"
"141","00:08:23:17","00:08:27:12","reduce distractions, we're going
to block interrupts, we're going"
"142","00:08:27:12","00:08:30:11","to hate one off requests from
customers that somehow are going"
"143","00:08:30:11","00:08:31:09","to distract us."
"144","00:08:31:16","00:08:36:00","And I know as, as the many time
had a product, every single"
"145","00:08:36:00","00:08:38:12","department in the company is
going to wander at some point."
"146","00:08:38:20","00:08:40:13","And we're going to have to keep
calling them back with"
"147","00:08:40:13","00:08:44:04","reminders. Who are we selling
to? Why are they going to buy?"
"148","00:08:44:12","00:08:47:06","Is this the most wonderful
thing? How do we talk about it?"
"149","00:08:47:13","00:08:50:15","Okay, so there's our animal
choice for head of product."
"150","00:08:50:21","00:08:55:07","Let's pick a few more. Here's
our Chief Revenue Officer, our"
"151","00:08:55:07","00:09:01:02","VP of sales, very aggressive by
nature, you know, fast, lethal."
"152","00:09:01:17","00:09:05:03","But what else do we know about
these, these hunting cats,"
"153","00:09:05:16","00:09:08:18","they're very focused, they bring
in the red meat, they tend to be"
"154","00:09:08:18","00:09:12:01","single account focused, right?
They're gonna find the weakest"
"155","00:09:12:01","00:09:14:18","prey out there, whichever the
envelope is easier to bring"
"156","00:09:14:18","00:09:18:22","down. And they're tremendously
focused on the current quarter."
"157","00:09:19:04","00:09:22:21","Every salesperson I know can
tell me to the exact number, how"
"158","00:09:22:21","00:09:25:02","many days are left in the
quarter and how much of their"
"159","00:09:25:02","00:09:28:21","quota they've retired. And they
strongly believe that they"
"160","00:09:28:21","00:09:31:16","really know exactly what the
customer wants, even though"
"161","00:09:31:17","00:09:35:05","everything about selling is
about pushing our point of view"
"162","00:09:35:06","00:09:38:10","and getting the users or the
buyers or their prospects to say"
"163","00:09:38:10","00:09:42:14","yes, instead of delving deeply
and finding out what their real"
"164","00:09:42:14","00:09:44:03","issues are, so we can solve
them."
"165","00:09:44:21","00:09:49:04","When I see product management
teams working for sales - so"
"166","00:09:49:04","00:09:52:17","either we move the product team
under the sales organization, or"
"167","00:09:52:17","00:09:57:21","we bring a head of sales over to
run product very quickly. What"
"168","00:09:57:21","00:10:01:22","we discover is the whole product
team has really become the order"
"169","00:10:01:22","00:10:06:11","ticking handmaidens to sales.
We're working on single decks"
"170","00:10:06:11","00:10:10:12","for single meetings or
customers. And we've given up"
"171","00:10:10:12","00:10:14:15","our whole strategic roadmap in
favor of whatever the top few"
"172","00:10:14:15","00:10:18:05","customers have asked for in the
last, I don't know, 10 minutes."
"173","00:10:18:13","00:10:18:21","Okay."
"174","00:10:18:21","00:10:22:17","So while I love having a head of
sales, a chief revenue officer,"
"175","00:10:22:17","00:10:25:09","and I've failed at doing it
myself, so I know it's really"
"176","00:10:25:09","00:10:29:12","hard, I can't see bringing those
folks in to run a product team."
"177","00:10:29:13","00:10:33:04","Okay, some other choices. For
any of you who are CEOs, I hope"
"178","00:10:33:04","00:10:38:11","this looks familiar. When I see
a CEO who's doing well seven"
"179","00:10:38:11","00:10:41:16","other things, and has one of the
eight tentacles on the product"
"180","00:10:41:16","00:10:46:11","side, we've got a part time time
sliced person running product."
"181","00:10:47:03","00:10:50:24","Generally, the failures I see
are around sampling. Many of you"
"182","00:10:50:24","00:10:56:05","who been CEOs know that the most
frequent calls you get are for"
"183","00:10:56:05","00:10:59:09","some big current customer who's
unhappy, because you never hear"
"184","00:10:59:09","00:11:02:02","from the small ones. And from
all of your sales teams to help"
"185","00:11:02:02","00:11:05:20","you lobby the next sales deal.
So you've got a very strange"
"186","00:11:06:00","00:11:09:12","recency bias view of life. And
you're not going to be able to"
"187","00:11:09:12","00:11:13:02","spend the time to worry about
strategy and product and pricing"
"188","00:11:13:02","00:11:16:04","and positioning and all the
things that product needs to do."
"189","00:11:16:06","00:11:20:03","So we need one of these CEOs,
but we sure don't need them as a"
"190","00:11:20:03","00:11:20:21","head of product."
"191","00:11:20:24","00:11:24:21","Okay, a few more choices. Let's
think about our VP engineering"
"192","00:11:24:21","00:11:29:00","because often, I see the product
team tucked in under the CTO,"
"193","00:11:29:00","00:11:32:23","the CIO, the VP engineering, and
these tend to be a lot more"
"194","00:11:32:23","00:11:35:02","methodical, they're orderly,
they're thoughtful, they're"
"195","00:11:35:02","00:11:39:06","patient, tough, right? Many of
them are nocturnal. We don't see"
"196","00:11:39:06","00:11:41:24","them so much early in the
office. And while they're very"
"197","00:11:41:24","00:11:46:01","communicative, they're mostly
communicate over Slack. So we"
"198","00:11:46:01","00:11:49:04","don't hear from them that much.
We know they're emotional, but"
"199","00:11:49:04","00:11:54:08","we don't see it so much. And
what I see often with VPs of"
"200","00:11:54:08","00:11:59:00","engineering, is they have this
very odd strange belief that all"
"201","00:11:59:00","00:12:02:16","of our customers are rational,
that they evaluate all the tech"
"202","00:12:02:16","00:12:07:05","or product strictly on a
rational straightforward bases."
"203","00:12:07:10","00:12:10:19","And that buying and selling are
easy that what sales reps do is"
"204","00:12:10:19","00:12:14:00","they bring a price list and a
presentation, and they collect"
"205","00:12:14:00","00:12:17:15","purchase orders. So while it's
great, again, to have a VP of"
"206","00:12:17:15","00:12:21:03","engineering, they those folks
tend not to have strong"
"207","00:12:21:03","00:12:25:11","understanding of selling, or
marketing or positioning, or"
"208","00:12:25:14","00:12:28:16","many of the things that we have
to do on the product side. So"
"209","00:12:28:16","00:12:32:15","stuff gets sold. So not as bad
as some of the other choices."
"210","00:12:32:15","00:12:35:18","But again, not my favorite,
let's go we have a couple more"
"211","00:12:35:18","00:12:36:07","choices."
"212","00:12:38:06","00:12:41:01","Here's some folks I love at
every company I've ever worked"
"213","00:12:41:01","00:12:43:18","for. They're the customer
support and Customer Success"
"214","00:12:43:18","00:12:47:00","people. What do we know about
them? We know they're"
"215","00:12:47:03","00:12:51:08","tremendously huge supporters of
their customers, they're going"
"216","00:12:51:08","00:12:54:02","to go the extra, not just the
single kilometer, they'll"
"217","00:12:54:02","00:12:58:02","they'll go the extra 100 miles,
they do tend to be single"
"218","00:12:58:07","00:13:02:03","customer or single account folks
at a time. Often your customer"
"219","00:13:02:03","00:13:06:10","success team is assigned long
term to just one customer. And"
"220","00:13:06:10","00:13:09:02","as you can see here, they're
willing to take that one"
"221","00:13:09:02","00:13:13:06","customer over every bump and
through every traffic signal and"
"222","00:13:13:06","00:13:16:04","stopping at every corner,
whether that's good for the"
"223","00:13:16:04","00:13:20:00","company or not as a whole. So
they're never trained to say no,"
"224","00:13:20:04","00:13:24:07","they're trained to say yes, and
to help that one customer figure"
"225","00:13:24:07","00:13:27:23","out how to do the one special
thing. When we put our product"
"226","00:13:27:23","00:13:31:16","hats on, we usually take a
different point of view. Instead"
"227","00:13:31:16","00:13:34:20","of asking how we can help be of
the most help to our next"
"228","00:13:34:20","00:13:40:08","customer. We ask how we can
engineer away most of the human"
"229","00:13:40:08","00:13:44:03","support, can we make onboarding
easier? Can we create tools? Can"
"230","00:13:44:03","00:13:47:15","we make the workflows better?
How do we get out from under the"
"231","00:13:47:15","00:13:52:03","support and success work as
opposed to do more of it? And"
"232","00:13:52:03","00:13:54:02","know that we're the most
important folks on the planet?"
"233","00:13:55:12","00:13:58:13","Okay, take a breath here. I
think we've got maybe one more."
"234","00:13:59:06","00:14:02:09","Here's the one that doesn't
happen so often, but I run into"
"235","00:14:02:09","00:14:06:07","sometimes we'll take a moment
because you all know what the"
"236","00:14:06:07","00:14:12:13","picture is going to be right? So
here's my new baby puppy, six"
"237","00:14:12:13","00:14:17:06","weeks, or maybe six months as a
product manager, excuse me, I"
"238","00:14:17:06","00:14:20:10","usually expect it's going to
take maybe three or four years"
"239","00:14:20:10","00:14:24:09","to grow this puppy up to be a
really, really terrific product"
"240","00:14:24:09","00:14:27:16","manager and another three or
four years to grow them up to be"
"241","00:14:27:16","00:14:30:04","a product leader where there
might be a director and heading"
"242","00:14:30:04","00:14:30:21","up a team."
"243","00:14:31:04","00:14:34:07","And most importantly, having
done this a bunch of times I"
"244","00:14:34:07","00:14:37:06","know that when I', hiring
somebody who's never been a"
"245","00:14:37:06","00:14:40:01","product manager before I as the
product leader, I'm going to"
"246","00:14:40:01","00:14:43:21","spend a lot of time house
training, right coaching and"
"247","00:14:43:21","00:14:47:04","mentoring and business life
skills. We're not going to send"
"248","00:14:47:04","00:14:50:09","this puppy in to an important
meeting with our biggest"
"249","00:14:50:09","00:14:55:10","customer until we've given it
some training. And as every head"
"250","00:14:55:10","00:14:58:05","of product knows, there's going
to be a bunch of accidents and"
"251","00:14:58:05","00:15:01:03","we may have to clean up the
carpet. Add or even replace it a"
"252","00:15:01:03","00:15:06:18","few times. So, while I love
having newly minted or freshly"
"253","00:15:06:18","00:15:10:24","arrived product managers on the
team, I wouldn't put them in as"
"254","00:15:10:24","00:15:11:18","head of product."
"255","00:15:12:24","00:15:17:03","Okay, so we're through most of
our animals. Let's, let's open"
"256","00:15:17:03","00:15:24:05","this up. Where are we? Here we
go. And I think we want to, we"
"257","00:15:24:05","00:15:26:02","want to ask you guys again,
let's come back to our"
"258","00:15:26:02","00:15:29:00","tweetstorm. Just for fun,
because I'm going to give us"
"259","00:15:29:01","00:15:34:24","briefly really three different
thoughts for, you know,"
"260","00:15:35:01","00:15:38:19","misconceptions that may be
underlying this. And I'm having"
"261","00:15:38:19","00:15:41:08","a lot of trouble finding my chat
window, but I'm sure we'll get"
"262","00:15:41:08","00:15:50:06","there. So go ahead. If anybody
has an idea, why don't you give"
"263","00:15:50:06","00:15:52:23","me an idea - one or two or three
- type them in, something that's"
"264","00:15:52:23","00:15:55:24","a core misconception from the
rest of the executive team,"
"265","00:15:56:07","00:15:59:12","about what product leadership is
or what we need? So I can break"
"266","00:15:59:12","00:16:03:11","those down. And don't wait, just
drop them in. It's just about"
"267","00:16:03:11","00:16:04:00","prioritizing work."
"268","00:16:04:00","00:16:06:18","John, you're exactly right.
Doesn't know the real value."
"269","00:16:06:18","00:16:10:05","Ouch, that hurts. It's all about
which feature next product owns"
"270","00:16:10:05","00:16:14:07","the voice of the customer?
Right? Getting software built"
"271","00:16:14:07","00:16:17:22","faster? That was the winning
answer I wanted. Only product"
"272","00:16:17:22","00:16:20:10","management knows the answers. I
believe that but nobody else"
"273","00:16:20:10","00:16:24:06","believes it, right? Why do we
need you anyway, engineering"
"274","00:16:24:06","00:16:26:17","builds it, I'd love it. These
are all spot on?"
"275","00:16:26:20","00:16:31:16","Okay, so here's the three I
picked out. The first one, and I"
"276","00:16:31:16","00:16:36:03","think several of you said there,
right? That what we really need"
"277","00:16:36:04","00:16:40:05","is we need product engineering
to say yes to the sales side of"
"278","00:16:40:05","00:16:42:23","the house more often. And so
therefore what product"
"279","00:16:42:24","00:16:46:13","management product leadership
should be doing? Is whipping the"
"280","00:16:46:13","00:16:50:16","engineers harder, right? How do
we get more stuff out of the"
"281","00:16:50:19","00:16:52:08","development side of the house."
"282","00:16:52:21","00:16:57:00","The second thing I run into a
lot is, oh, well, our products"
"283","00:16:57:00","00:17:01:13","really very complicated. And so
nobody can understand our"
"284","00:17:01:13","00:17:04:11","product unless they have at
least one or two advanced"
"285","00:17:04:11","00:17:08:00","degrees in our thing. So it's
not possible to hire any product"
"286","00:17:08:00","00:17:10:24","managers, unless they also
happen to have been at a famous"
"287","00:17:10:24","00:17:13:18","university with a thesis on our
stuff, right."
"288","00:17:14:01","00:17:16:24","And then the third one, which I
think several of you had there"
"289","00:17:16:24","00:17:22:00","is the executive team has this
odd belief that our strategies"
"290","00:17:22:00","00:17:25:14","are so clear, and so aligned and
the OKRs is so well written,"
"291","00:17:25:20","00:17:29:13","that everybody's going to just
do the right thing and be on the"
"292","00:17:29:13","00:17:33:15","right page without much help.
And honestly, I think I've never"
"293","00:17:33:15","00:17:34:16","found this to be true."
"294","00:17:35:02","00:17:40:03","So let's unpack these three,
just a little bit. And here we"
"295","00:17:40:03","00:17:45:01","go. So if anybody's at this
engineering organization, but"
"296","00:17:45:01","00:17:47:13","this is every engineering team
or development team I've ever"
"297","00:17:47:13","00:17:52:11","met, there is no development
team on the planet that isn't"
"298","00:17:52:11","00:17:57:15","already overloaded and has too
much to do 2x 5x 10x. Yet, the"
"299","00:17:57:15","00:18:00:12","executive team tells us that
what we really want is to push"
"300","00:18:00:12","00:18:03:23","harder, right? So the executive
team, the go to market team,"
"301","00:18:04:04","00:18:07:11","there's usually some hot issue
in their head, right? Just got"
"302","00:18:07:11","00:18:10:07","off a call with a customer. But
every dev team is"
"303","00:18:10:07","00:18:14:01","oversubscribed. And so we end up
in this ADHD model of"
"304","00:18:14:01","00:18:19:02","roadmapping. Where every 2.5
minutes, it turns out, we've got"
"305","00:18:19:02","00:18:22:11","a new strategy. And the failure
mode I see. In fact, I'm writing"
"306","00:18:22:11","00:18:25:14","a really long piece for one of
my clients on this is that we"
"307","00:18:25:14","00:18:28:23","have too many number one items.
And our answer when something's"
"308","00:18:28:23","00:18:32:15","important is to make another new
thing. Another top number one"
"309","00:18:32:15","00:18:35:23","items, so we constantly add, and
the team actually never finishes"
"310","00:18:35:23","00:18:39:18","anything. Right? So the
reputation that engineering gets"
"311","00:18:39:18","00:18:42:10","is that they're losers or
slackers are sitting around"
"312","00:18:42:10","00:18:46:17","eating bonbons, when the root
issue of course, is we've taken"
"313","00:18:46:17","00:18:49:14","on four times as much as we can,
and we're thrashing."
"314","00:18:50:04","00:18:54:03","Right second of these, right,
only our special experts can"
"315","00:18:54:03","00:18:58:02","understand here's our product
manager unable to find her way"
"316","00:18:58:02","00:19:01:05","through the maze, because too
complicated. And I've taken"
"317","00:19:01:05","00:19:04:18","notes over the years. And the
winner I think was, Oh, our"
"318","00:19:04:18","00:19:08:22","company's doing six factor
authentication. And no one can"
"319","00:19:08:22","00:19:12:00","understand Understand six factor
authentication, unless they've"
"320","00:19:12:00","00:19:14:19","got at least one or two advanced
degrees in CES and"
"321","00:19:14:19","00:19:18:03","authentication. So there is no
product manager who's going to"
"322","00:19:18:03","00:19:21:23","understand this. Now, that's a
bit of a problem, not just for"
"323","00:19:21:23","00:19:24:00","the product manager, but
probably for the customers,"
"324","00:19:24:00","00:19:28:11","right? Because if we can't
explain it to a product manager,"
"325","00:19:28:15","00:19:32:07","then we probably can't sell it
to anybody. Right? And when we"
"326","00:19:32:07","00:19:35:20","hire a subject expert who's
never worn the product badge"
"327","00:19:35:20","00:19:37:07","before, here's what I see."
"328","00:19:38:04","00:19:41:14","First of all, those subject
experts usually don't ever think"
"329","00:19:41:14","00:19:44:05","about the newbies, the
onboarding, the economics,"
"330","00:19:44:10","00:19:46:18","they're always thinking about
the two or three buddies of"
"331","00:19:46:18","00:19:51:04","theirs, who are the power high
end users, and they routinely"
"332","00:19:51:04","00:19:54:23","decide that their point of view
is so much more accurate than"
"333","00:19:54:23","00:19:56:20","what anything we're going to
learn from customers is of"
"334","00:19:56:20","00:20:00:16","course customers don't know what
they want that They put"
"335","00:20:00:16","00:20:03:17","themselves in the place of
already knowing all the answers"
"336","00:20:03:18","00:20:06:16","instead of going out and doing
what every good product person"
"337","00:20:06:16","00:20:10:07","does, which is endlessly,
repeatedly every single day,"
"338","00:20:10:16","00:20:13:06","talking to lots of users and
customers and prospects and"
"339","00:20:13:06","00:20:16:21","partners and lost deals, to find
out what's actually true in the"
"340","00:20:16:21","00:20:21:00","world. And my observation is, if
you give your newly arrived"
"341","00:20:21:00","00:20:23:19","Product Manager a couple of
months of halftime, send them"
"342","00:20:23:19","00:20:27:12","out on the road, have them do 20
or 30 customer meetings, they'll"
"343","00:20:27:12","00:20:30:20","come back understanding
everything they need. So this"
"344","00:20:30:20","00:20:34:15","idea is I think, fallacious,
it's just not true. But so many"
"345","00:20:34:15","00:20:38:22","places end up hiring a subject
expert who honestly couldn't"
"346","00:20:38:22","00:20:41:10","spell product, if you gave him
all the consonants in the"
"347","00:20:41:10","00:20:42:02","correct order."
"348","00:20:43:11","00:20:46:14","And then my third one here,
here's our geese all lined up."
"349","00:20:46:14","00:20:49:02","Here's our beautiful strategy.
everything's aligned, everybody"
"350","00:20:49:02","00:20:53:07","knows where we're going. The
first thing I find when"
"351","00:20:53:07","00:20:57:22","customers or companies adopt
OKRs, is they adopt first just"
"352","00:20:57:22","00:21:00:23","some revenue OKRs. Right, our
goal for the quarter is to make"
"353","00:21:00:24","00:21:05:04","20 million. And, you know, that
might suggest that I'm going to"
"354","00:21:05:09","00:21:08:13","sell off some my household
furniture for revenue or stand"
"355","00:21:08:13","00:21:11:06","on the corner in a very short
skirt, it's not a pretty sight."
"356","00:21:12:24","00:21:16:14","When we try to, to figure out
how to apply that to product,"
"357","00:21:16:14","00:21:20:16","it's a zero help in figuring out
what's more important, or most"
"358","00:21:20:16","00:21:24:02","important, because we haven't
yet gotten down to target"
"359","00:21:24:02","00:21:26:21","audiences and positioning and
where we're going to win where"
"360","00:21:26:21","00:21:27:17","we're going to not win."
"361","00:21:28:05","00:21:31:18","The other thing I see in these
organizations is that all the"
"362","00:21:31:18","00:21:36:03","OKRs are really functional level
ones. Finance has its goals."
"363","00:21:36:08","00:21:39:21","Marketing has its goals, and
they simply don't ever touch."
"364","00:21:40:11","00:21:44:13","Part of what we do is head of
product back to our sheepdog is,"
"365","00:21:44:16","00:21:49:02","I spent an awful lot of my time
trying to get my executive peers"
"366","00:21:49:09","00:21:53:20","to line up their their goals and
maybe measure the right thing. I"
"367","00:21:53:20","00:21:56:17","don't know if you've ever been
in a company where the support"
"368","00:21:56:17","00:22:02:17","team has a goal of shortening
their average call. And you know"
"369","00:22:02:17","00:22:06:08","what they do it. And the way
they do it is they throw folks"
"370","00:22:06:08","00:22:09:14","off the phone, and they don't
solve the problems. So those"
"371","00:22:09:14","00:22:12:15","people can call back, but the
average call is shorter. You"
"372","00:22:12:15","00:22:15:02","know, when we create goals, we
have to be really thoughtful,"
"373","00:22:15:02","00:22:18:03","because folks are going to do
just what we asked them paid"
"374","00:22:18:03","00:22:18:15","them to do."
"375","00:22:19:16","00:22:23:24","Alright, so there's our three
misconceptions. Here's a sort of"
"376","00:22:24:02","00:22:26:19","takeaway thought for me, by the
way, I put a post up over the"
"377","00:22:26:19","00:22:30:17","weekend. That's the long form
text version of this. So anybody"
"378","00:22:30:17","00:22:34:07","who feels like they want to read
the 2000 words, just go to my"
"379","00:22:34:07","00:22:37:13","website, but he was the takeaway
from that, right? What are the"
"380","00:22:37:13","00:22:41:24","key skills, right? A lot of
negotiating a lot of empathy, a"
"381","00:22:41:24","00:22:45:08","lot of horse trading among the
internal stakeholders. But"
"382","00:22:45:08","00:22:48:14","somebody's got to stand up for
the real customers. I'm always"
"383","00:22:48:14","00:22:53:03","channeling the original Tron
movie from 1982, where they say,"
"384","00:22:53:15","00:22:57:06","we fight for the users, we don't
fight for the stakeholders, we"
"385","00:22:57:06","00:22:58:06","fight for the users."
"386","00:22:58:13","00:23:01:21","Okay, so having done all that,
I'm going to flash past three"
"387","00:23:02:01","00:23:04:20","quick slides here. I'm not even
going to bother reading them"
"388","00:23:04:20","00:23:08:22","all. But I put together some
interview questions that when we"
"389","00:23:08:22","00:23:11:22","look at the videotape, or you
pull down the slide set, you"
"390","00:23:11:22","00:23:14:16","might want to borrow the next
time you're interviewing you had"
"391","00:23:14:16","00:23:18:04","a product. So instead of asking
how can we get more on the"
"392","00:23:18:04","00:23:22:20","roadmap? Here's a couple of
better questions, right? And"
"393","00:23:22:20","00:23:25:20","instead of how are you going to
get more productivity out of our"
"394","00:23:25:20","00:23:29:16","development team, whipping them
harder? Here's an alternative."
"395","00:23:30:10","00:23:34:03","Right? Likewise, instead of
asking, Are you a subject"
"396","00:23:34:03","00:23:38:03","expert? Have you worked in our
exact tech segment and already"
"397","00:23:38:03","00:23:41:21","know what customers want? Wrong?
Here's a couple of ways you"
"398","00:23:41:21","00:23:43:16","might unpack that in an
interview."
"399","00:23:44:13","00:23:48:24","And then one last one. I'm not a
fan of Net Promoter Score,"
"400","00:23:48:24","00:23:51:20","because it's pretty random and
doesn't give us much information"
"401","00:23:51:20","00:23:56:04","and it's easy to manipulate. So
here's a few better questions,"
"402","00:23:56:04","00:23:59:16","then NPS score to figure out how
we're going to understand what"
"403","00:23:59:16","00:24:03:00","our customers are doing. Okay, I
want to leave a lot of time for"
"404","00:24:03:00","00:24:07:20","questions. So let's go to a few
takeaways. Right? Got to have a"
"405","00:24:07:20","00:24:10:17","treat at the end. Everybody got
to the end. Here's your treat."
"406","00:24:11:13","00:24:14:11","So here's our three things,
right. And if we were in the"
"407","00:24:14:11","00:24:17:22","hall together in Boston, I might
actually ask everybody to stand"
"408","00:24:17:22","00:24:21:09","up and repeat this. But I think
you can do that in the privacy"
"409","00:24:21:09","00:24:24:06","of your own desks here. Right?
Product management experience,"
"410","00:24:24:06","00:24:28:23","product leadership experience.
Before subject market technical"
"411","00:24:28:23","00:24:32:13","specifics, right? Please, Oh,
please, oh, please, don't bring"
"412","00:24:32:13","00:24:34:05","in somebody just because they
know your tech."
"413","00:24:36:07","00:24:39:07","The thing we do, how do we add
value? Why do we care? Why does"
"414","00:24:39:07","00:24:42:15","anybody else care? It's because
often the product management"
"415","00:24:42:15","00:24:45:12","team and therefore the product
management leader, are the"
"416","00:24:45:12","00:24:48:20","people balancing long term
scratch strategy against current"
"417","00:24:48:20","00:24:55:04","quarter execution. And we are
endlessly battling the fight of"
"418","00:24:55:20","00:24:59:04","should we do this one special
little thing for this one big"
"419","00:24:59:04","00:25:03:11","customer who promises never to
ask us anything else again, at"
"420","00:25:03:11","00:25:07:05","least until later in the day? Or
are we going to let the entire"
"421","00:25:07:05","00:25:11:01","development team be diverted to
whatever three or four shiny"
"422","00:25:11:01","00:25:15:21","objects have come up in today's
sales calls? And then, you know,"
"423","00:25:15:22","00:25:19:05","what do we do leadership skills,
things we need, right? We need"
"424","00:25:19:05","00:25:23:07","to be able to keep the rest of
the executive team focused. not"
"425","00:25:23:07","00:25:23:22","trivial."
"426","00:25:24:03","00:25:28:10","We need to keep our eyes on the
market success, the segments,"
"427","00:25:28:17","00:25:32:10","the larger picture, not single
accounts, we got to spend a"
"428","00:25:32:10","00:25:35:15","tremendous amount of time
understanding and loving all of"
"429","00:25:35:15","00:25:39:04","our peers across all the
organizations. And then last of"
"430","00:25:39:04","00:25:43:03","all, back to our puppy photo.
We've got to raise those young"
"431","00:25:43:03","00:25:47:16","uns, those soon to be product
managers, mentoring, tutoring,"
"432","00:25:47:21","00:25:50:07","teaching them how to do it,
cleaning up the carpet as"
"433","00:25:50:07","00:25:53:13","necessary. So that's the things
I think we're looking for in a"
"434","00:25:53:13","00:25:58:06","head of product. And I hope that
that helps us helps you with a"
"435","00:25:58:06","00:26:00:14","better frame around that. And
then just circling back to"
"436","00:26:00:14","00:26:03:01","Mark's point from the very
beginning, you could apply this"
"437","00:26:03:01","00:26:06:21","to any of your functions. I just
happen to tell it as a product"
"438","00:26:06:21","00:26:10:22","leadership story, because that's
my part of the problem. All"
"439","00:26:10:22","00:26:13:10","right, here's how to find me.
That's the website. That's the"
"440","00:26:13:10","00:26:16:08","email. That's the Twitter
handle. Anybody notice it's hard"
"441","00:26:16:08","00:26:18:00","to spell, but it's all the same?"
"442","00:26:20:09","00:26:22:04","Let's have a little round of
applause first."
"443","00:26:22:17","00:26:31:15","I'll pick a few of these off the
chat, just start. Anybody wants"
"444","00:26:31:15","00:26:35:20","to break in with with the audio
later. So so lots of good"
"445","00:26:35:20","00:26:36:09","questions."
"446","00:26:36:09","00:26:39:18","I'm going to start with with the
top one from from Brian: these"
"447","00:26:39:18","00:26:42:08","issues have existed since the
beginning of software product"
"448","00:26:42:17","00:26:47:00","businesses. Why is it so hard to
solve? I think part of it is"
"449","00:26:47:00","00:26:50:23","that most of what product
management does is sort of"
"450","00:26:50:23","00:26:54:04","transparent, right? When it's
working, you don't see it. And"
"451","00:26:54:04","00:26:57:15","when it's broken, you're usually
miss attributing it. So most of"
"452","00:26:57:15","00:27:01:15","the calls I get are from CEOs
who tell me their engineering"
"453","00:27:01:15","00:27:06:00","team doesn't work hard enough or
isn't productive or is lazy. And"
"454","00:27:06:00","00:27:09:24","then when we open the box, we
figure out that there's no goals"
"455","00:27:09:24","00:27:13:11","for the company, or they're in
complete conflict. And the CEO"
"456","00:27:13:13","00:27:18:04","comes down no more frequently
than let's say, every 25 minutes"
"457","00:27:18:05","00:27:20:18","to the development organization
with a new number one priority."
"458","00:27:21:02","00:27:24:12","And they're dejected and
frustrated. And what they really"
"459","00:27:24:12","00:27:27:24","need more than anything else is
a product management team,"
"460","00:27:27:24","00:27:30:22","especially a head of product,
that's the semi permeable"
"461","00:27:30:22","00:27:34:14","membrane, the funnel, the
umbrella, such that the rest of"
"462","00:27:34:14","00:27:37:24","the company has to go through
something painful, before we can"
"463","00:27:37:24","00:27:40:13","interrupt what we've already
agreed to be in the sprint."
"464","00:27:40:14","00:27:44:16","So that's not the obvious skill.
Everybody thinks about writing"
"465","00:27:44:16","00:27:48:12","user stories. Honestly, I don't
care about user stories, and I"
"466","00:27:48:12","00:27:52:08","don't care what format we have
them in. Turns out a"
"467","00:27:52:08","00:27:56:03","grammatically correct user story
is usually probably still the"
"468","00:27:56:03","00:27:58:13","wrong thing we should build.
It's not the grammar we want to"
"469","00:27:58:13","00:28:02:01","check. It's whether we did our
homework and truly understand"
"470","00:28:02:01","00:28:07:00","our customers, which is hard to
see. So the other thing, the"
"471","00:28:07:00","00:28:09:13","failure mode here is a lot of
folks have never been at a"
"472","00:28:09:13","00:28:13:06","company where product management
was any darn good. And so they"
"473","00:28:13:06","00:28:15:17","don't have a model in their head
what we're supposed to do."
"474","00:28:16:12","00:28:20:13","Okay, good. Tim Burgess: How do
you build consensus or strength"
"475","00:28:20:14","00:28:23:19","of your voice when the other
executives are ostensibly more"
"476","00:28:23:19","00:28:26:00","important? or higher profile?"
"477","00:28:27:00","00:28:31:17","Really good question. I think of
every good product manager, as a"
"478","00:28:31:17","00:28:35:07","student of human behavior,
right? We've all read Dale"
"479","00:28:35:07","00:28:38:08","Carnegie's book from the 1920s,
about how to make friends and"
"480","00:28:38:08","00:28:41:10","influence people, we all
understand what the different"
"481","00:28:41:10","00:28:44:16","departments value and how
they're measured. We think a lot"
"482","00:28:44:16","00:28:49:22","about motivations and goals and
alignment. And so for instance,"
"483","00:28:50:01","00:28:53:07","the way I talk, the marketing
and sales side of the house,"
"484","00:28:53:07","00:28:56:10","through my roadmap, is entirely
different than the way I'd go"
"485","00:28:56:10","00:28:59:16","through it with my engineering
team. It's the same roadmap. But"
"486","00:28:59:16","00:29:03:09","on the sales side, we're almost
all talking about who it's for,"
"487","00:29:04:05","00:29:08:01","why they want it, and how can we
should be able to get full price"
"488","00:29:08:01","00:29:10:05","for it. Whereas on the
engineering side, we're talking"
"489","00:29:10:05","00:29:13:12","a lot more about the inner
workings of the problems we're"
"490","00:29:13:12","00:29:17:03","solving. So there's a lot of
channeling the different"
"491","00:29:17:08","00:29:20:04","audiences and what they need.
And then there's a tremendous"
"492","00:29:20:04","00:29:24:09","amount of honestly, horse
trading and alignment here."
"493","00:29:25:00","00:29:28:08","Many of you know this, but every
single person in your support"
"494","00:29:28:08","00:29:32:24","organization expects to get 100%
of developments effort against"
"495","00:29:32:24","00:29:37:00","fixing bugs. And everybody in
your sales organization expects"
"496","00:29:37:01","00:29:41:06","engineering to spend 100% of
their effort on whatever these"
"497","00:29:41:06","00:29:45:07","new deals need. And your success
team wants 100% of their effort"
"498","00:29:45:07","00:29:48:16","against simpler workflows and
better onboarding. And your"
"499","00:29:48:16","00:29:51:24","engineering team wants to spend
80% on fixing your tech debt and"
"500","00:29:52:03","00:29:55:06","doing factoring. So there's
actually no way to get to a good"
"501","00:29:55:06","00:30:00:01","answer here. Unless we set up
some you know allocations in"
"502","00:30:00:01","00:30:03:06","agreements about how we're going
to work here. So I spend a lot"
"503","00:30:03:06","00:30:06:03","of my time trying to get
consensus on how we're going to"
"504","00:30:06:03","00:30:10:02","spend our general money before
we fall down the rabbit hole of"
"505","00:30:10:02","00:30:11:23","tickets. Okay."
"506","00:30:13:05","00:30:16:23","David Carta: what order would
you hire people beyond founders,"
"507","00:30:16:23","00:30:19:01","CFO, product manager, VP sales."
"508","00:30:19:22","00:30:23:11","That's a hard one. Because
usually the founders come from"
"509","00:30:23:21","00:30:27:17","some side, if they're
technologists, I probably want"
"510","00:30:27:17","00:30:31:14","to get maybe an early business
development person as opposed to"
"511","00:30:31:14","00:30:34:19","a salesperson. Because for the
first year, honestly, we don't"
"512","00:30:34:19","00:30:36:24","know what we're selling. And
we're going to have to take our"
"513","00:30:36:24","00:30:41:06","word back a few times, I usually
expect a company a startup to"
"514","00:30:41:06","00:30:45:20","hire its first full time product
manager, and about 12 people."
"515","00:30:46:11","00:30:49:02","Because then by then you've got
a development team and"
"516","00:30:49:02","00:30:52:09","engineering team of six or
seven, that's enough to justify"
"517","00:30:52:09","00:30:55:17","a product manager, I don't
really see a head of product or"
"518","00:30:55:17","00:31:02:08","VP of product until we get to, I
don't know 3035. Because there's"
"519","00:31:02:08","00:31:05:13","just not enough scope there. If
I come in as the head of product"
"520","00:31:05:13","00:31:09:16","at a 12 person company, I have
to be also willing to do all the"
"521","00:31:09:16","00:31:13:13","individual contributor work,
which is fine, but not everybody"
"522","00:31:13:13","00:31:15:06","is willing to do that. Okay."
"523","00:31:17:01","00:31:20:15","That's a great question from Go
ahead. And Mark Davis wants to"
"524","00:31:20:15","00:31:24:15","ask the CEO to validate they do
in fact, want to give up the"
"525","00:31:24:15","00:31:25:04","reins."
"526","00:31:26:14","00:31:31:05","This is hard, because almost
every CEO will say yes to that."
"527","00:31:33:24","00:31:35:03","Really no, right?"
"528","00:31:35:03","00:31:38:19","That's right, in practice, so
I'm not sure there's a question"
"529","00:31:38:19","00:31:44:19","I asked the CEO directly. Advice
I give to folks in every job: if"
"530","00:31:44:19","00:31:48:17","you're interviewing for a job at
a company is find some folks who"
"531","00:31:48:17","00:31:52:21","work at the company who are not
on the interview roster, get"
"532","00:31:52:21","00:31:55:14","into LinkedIn figured out who
you know, or who you're"
"533","00:31:55:14","00:31:59:15","connected, one hop away from. In
a better time, I would have said"
"534","00:31:59:15","00:32:03:14","take them out to breakfast. But
right now, it's virtual coffee,"
"535","00:32:03:19","00:32:07:05","and ask a lot of questions about
the company. Because first of"
"536","00:32:07:05","00:32:09:15","all, you want to learn about the
company before you get too far"
"537","00:32:09:15","00:32:10:17","in the interview cycle."
"538","00:32:10:24","00:32:15:18","But a question I always ask or
some variation is, would you"
"539","00:32:15:18","00:32:20:07","recommend a good friend of yours
work at this company? Surprising"
"540","00:32:20:07","00:32:24:15","how often that answer is no. How
about did the CEO have a bad"
"541","00:32:24:15","00:32:29:04","childhood? Often? That's it.
Yes. Right? Well, what we're"
"542","00:32:29:04","00:32:32:04","looking we're looking for here
is somebody who's not"
"543","00:32:32:04","00:32:35:10","sufficiently biased by being in
the interview cycle, which means"
"544","00:32:35:10","00:32:39:00","they're trying to sell me on the
job and figure out if I'm"
"545","00:32:39:00","00:32:42:19","selling hard enough, but find
somebody whose objective is"
"546","00:32:42:19","00:32:44:16","going to tell you what's going
on, what are the company"
"547","00:32:44:16","00:32:48:03","problems? How are they doing?
Are there layoffs coming? Just"
"548","00:32:48:03","00:32:52:02","does this person get joy coming
into the office? Because I find"
"549","00:32:52:02","00:32:55:00","when you could answer get good
answers to that your CEO is most"
"550","00:32:55:00","00:32:58:04","likely doing a lot of the right
things. And there's a good"
"551","00:32:58:04","00:33:00:21","chance that that head of product
is going to be allowed to"
"552","00:33:00:21","00:33:05:21","succeed. I would say half the
time on those discussions. What"
"553","00:33:05:21","00:33:10:08","I hear back from people is, huh,
huh? Can we take that one"
"554","00:33:10:08","00:33:14:06","offline? And no, I wouldn't
recommend that my best friend"
"555","00:33:14:06","00:33:18:00","take a job here. Right? You
don't want to work there. Move"
"556","00:33:18:00","00:33:22:20","on. There's other jobs. Okay,
how about one other one? Should"
"557","00:33:22:20","00:33:24:13","I just pick one out? Or if
there's somebody who wants to"
"558","00:33:24:13","00:33:26:07","come in on audio? That would be
fun?"
"559","00:33:27:05","00:33:31:01","I think yeah, let's find someone
that wants to come in on audio."
"560","00:33:32:17","00:33:36:08","So I find that in a lot of
companies, the head of product"
"561","00:33:36:08","00:33:39:24","means a lot of things. And
sometimes it's like, encroaching"
"562","00:33:39:24","00:33:43:11","across everything in the
company. And it's like owning"
"563","00:33:43:11","00:33:47:03","the customer. And I don't know
why. But so I just want to"
"564","00:33:47:03","00:33:50:20","clarify and have some opinion
from you. Like, what are the"
"565","00:33:50:21","00:33:54:04","what should be the
accountabilities of the head of"
"566","00:33:54:04","00:33:56:17","product or the accountabilities
of the product function?"
"567","00:33:56:24","00:34:00:03","Yeah, and this is hard, because
none of the things that Product"
"568","00:34:00:03","00:34:05:10","Management delivers are direct
customer consumables, right? And"
"569","00:34:05:10","00:34:08:15","products not actually in control
of any almost any of the"
"570","00:34:08:15","00:34:13:09","resources in the company. It's
hard to pin either success or"
"571","00:34:13:09","00:34:17:13","failure directly on product. So
I look for a lot of of secondary"
"572","00:34:17:13","00:34:20:22","things. Does everybody in the
company really understand what's"
"573","00:34:20:22","00:34:25:17","on the roadmap? Are we selling
to the right segments? Are we"
"574","00:34:25:17","00:34:28:21","mostly able to prop up our
prices and sell for something"
"575","00:34:28:21","00:34:34:12","near list price? A good
secondary thing is that sales"
"576","00:34:34:12","00:34:39:01","doesn't hate engineering. And
engineering doesn't hate sales."
"577","00:34:39:06","00:34:41:24","Because by the way, if that's
the case, product either can't"
"578","00:34:41:24","00:34:45:11","succeed, or has failed
miserably, right. So notice,"
"579","00:34:45:11","00:34:48:16","those are all sort of
interstitial things. Do we have"
"580","00:34:48:16","00:34:52:02","a product strategy that we stick
to? Again, you can knock that"
"581","00:34:52:02","00:34:55:11","down from almost any department,
but if product succeeding those"
"582","00:34:55:11","00:34:58:18","are things that everybody
immediately says yes to. And so"
"583","00:34:58:18","00:35:03:06","the head of product is as much
intent internal salesperson for"
"584","00:35:03:06","00:35:06:06","clarity and strategy and
segmentation in targeting and"
"585","00:35:06:06","00:35:10:23","staying on focus as anything
else. Thanks. Sure."
"586","00:35:10:23","00:35:15:01","So Peldi asked a question, which
was skelding. Any tips for"
"587","00:35:15:01","00:35:18:21","founders, CEOs to delegate Head
of Product responsibilities?"
"588","00:35:18:21","00:35:22:18","Probably being unusually shy
today?"
"589","00:35:23:01","00:35:28:12","Yeah. I don't know why Peldi.
But I think the that is the"
"590","00:35:28:12","00:35:32:01","right question, which is, can I
feel comfortable enough"
"591","00:35:32:01","00:35:35:10","delegating to the head of
product. And generally, the"
"592","00:35:35:13","00:35:40:24","failure mode here is around the
CEO believing that they are in"
"593","00:35:40:24","00:35:46:01","fact sampling the customer base
adequately, and that I know what"
"594","00:35:46:01","00:35:49:04","customers want, because I'm
talking to a lot of customers."
"595","00:35:49:11","00:35:53:05","And the reason that doesn't hold
up is because at least at this"
"596","00:35:53:05","00:35:56:07","stage, almost all the
conversations that the CEO is"
"597","00:35:56:07","00:35:59:12","having with customers are
pushed, they're selling, they're"
"598","00:35:59:12","00:36:03:14","trying to get somebody to agree.
And what you do when you listen"
"599","00:36:03:14","00:36:07:02","to those calls with the CEO is
you find out the CEO is talking"
"600","00:36:07:13","00:36:12:00","70% or 80% of the time, which is
a sales call. And the folks at"
"601","00:36:12:00","00:36:14:15","the other end are either
politely listening or raising"
"602","00:36:14:15","00:36:17:13","small objections. But they're
not really saying what they"
"603","00:36:17:13","00:36:21:20","think the other thing that CEOs
and founders get is they get the"
"604","00:36:22:02","00:36:26:22","rapid escalations from the few
large customers of random things"
"605","00:36:26:22","00:36:30:08","they're unhappy about. And so
they decide that all customers"
"606","00:36:30:08","00:36:33:03","are having this problem, because
they're sampling badly, right."
"607","00:36:33:07","00:36:36:18","And so, as a head of product,
what I need is some agreement"
"608","00:36:36:18","00:36:41:19","from the CEO, that if I can show
data, if my team is interviewing"
"609","00:36:41:19","00:36:45:17","40 customers a month or 90
customers a month, that we're"
"610","00:36:45:17","00:36:50:01","going to get believed that when
we identify that 65% of the"
"611","00:36:50:01","00:36:53:24","customers have an issue, but
it's not the one that CEO heard"
"612","00:36:53:24","00:36:57:10","about this morning, that we're
gonna get a hearing on that and"
"613","00:36:57:10","00:37:01:06","facts matter. And that's really
hard emotionally for the CEO,"
"614","00:37:01:06","00:37:04:20","because, you know, we're all the
center of our universes. And we"
"615","00:37:04:20","00:37:10:11","believe that what we're seeing
is a you know, an effective and"
"616","00:37:10:17","00:37:12:00","well sampled pattern."
"617","00:37:16:15","00:37:20:22","Okay, I'm gonna pick one more,
Tim, we got from Tim, how about"
"618","00:37:20:22","00:37:24:01","Elizabeth Aveda: when should a
company hire it's first product"
"619","00:37:24:01","00:37:26:00","manager? I think we touched
that, you know, again, I'm"
"620","00:37:26:00","00:37:29:17","thinking like 12 employees, 14
employees."
"621","00:37:31:02","00:37:35:18","Let's see what we got. Igor
says: In what form is"
"622","00:37:35:18","00:37:38:05","understanding the customer
captured? Is it just in a"
"623","00:37:38:05","00:37:41:13","product managers head, this is a
really hard problem, because"
"624","00:37:41:13","00:37:45:12","it's rather unstructured. One of
the ways I coach my heads of"
"625","00:37:45:12","00:37:49:09","product and product managers is,
first of all, every time we"
"626","00:37:49:09","00:37:53:04","interview a customer, assuming
it's not a sales call, I want to"
"627","00:37:53:04","00:37:56:23","include on the call a designer
and developer. Now, they"
"628","00:37:56:23","00:38:00:24","probably don't talk, I run the
interview. But it's very clear,"
"629","00:38:00:24","00:38:03:19","they hear different things than
I do, and they listen for"
"630","00:38:03:21","00:38:04:18","different things."
"631","00:38:05:03","00:38:08:09","And we usually have some regime
where either they write me a"
"632","00:38:08:09","00:38:11:16","post it note, or they drop me a
Slack message on the side for"
"633","00:38:11:16","00:38:15:01","questions I'm missing, right, we
might have an hour's"
"634","00:38:15:01","00:38:18:18","conversation with a customer. So
we're going to capture that"
"635","00:38:18:18","00:38:20:17","we're gonna record it with
permission, of course, don't"
"636","00:38:20:17","00:38:23:05","want to break the law, we're
going to put that in a"
"637","00:38:23:05","00:38:27:03","repository. But right next to
it. At the very end of the call,"
"638","00:38:27:03","00:38:30:13","as soon as we're done before it
falls out of our heads, we're"
"639","00:38:30:13","00:38:34:12","going to among ourselves, pick
the three or four or five"
"640","00:38:34:12","00:38:38:11","takeaways, lessons, interesting
things, put them in bullets at"
"641","00:38:38:11","00:38:42:12","the very top, and send around to
the rest of the company, the"
"642","00:38:42:12","00:38:46:03","three bullets and a link to the
recording. That's important"
"643","00:38:46:03","00:38:49:00","because we do it right away. So
a recency bias isn't going to"
"644","00:38:49:00","00:38:52:07","get us in trouble. It helps
because the rest of the company"
"645","00:38:52:12","00:38:55:23","starts to notice that the
product team actually talks to"
"646","00:38:55:23","00:38:57:10","customers all the time."
"647","00:38:57:21","00:39:00:22","And then, in general, I find
that we don't know the right"
"648","00:39:00:22","00:39:05:05","questions until 10 interviews in
or 15 interviews and we have to"
"649","00:39:05:05","00:39:08:19","go back and read our notes.
Because something popped up in"
"650","00:39:08:19","00:39:12:24","five of those conversations,
that was so bizarre, that we"
"651","00:39:12:24","00:39:15:04","never even thought to ask and
we're going to go back to our"
"652","00:39:15:04","00:39:18:09","notes back to our recordings,
and figure out if it was a"
"653","00:39:18:09","00:39:21:19","pattern. So that's a way that we
can share them out, get this"
"654","00:39:21:19","00:39:24:14","summary to the rest of the
world. And anybody who needs to"
"655","00:39:24:14","00:39:29:13","dig deep configure out which
transcript or recording is going"
"656","00:39:29:13","00:39:31:05","to have the detailed stuff in
it."
"657","00:39:32:14","00:39:35:22","Hey, thanks for just a great
talk and answering so many"
"658","00:39:35:22","00:39:37:18","questions generously. I was
wondering if you could talk a"
"659","00:39:37:18","00:39:41:05","little bit more about the
smokejumper role and outside the"
"660","00:39:41:05","00:39:45:05","context of just fighting a
burning fire but also like as a"
"661","00:39:45:12","00:39:49:22","transition or even alternative
to hiring a full time w two"
"662","00:39:49:22","00:39:50:11","executive."
"663","00:39:50:19","00:39:54:13","Yeah, so I've done about a dozen
of those. And every time I"
"664","00:39:54:13","00:39:58:23","promised myself not to do it
again. Because honestly, they're"
"665","00:39:58:24","00:40:01:18","they're really hard and
irrationally painful. And it"
"666","00:40:01:18","00:40:06:21","does borrow from the firefighter
terminology because the, the"
"667","00:40:06:22","00:40:09:10","smoke jumpers are the ones who
are parachuted on the far side"
"668","00:40:09:10","00:40:12:16","of the fire, to knock down all
the fuel, and they don't get to"
"669","00:40:12:16","00:40:15:16","go home, smelly and tired and
smoky until they fought their"
"670","00:40:15:16","00:40:21:02","way back through the fire. I
don't advise anyone to do this,"
"671","00:40:21:02","00:40:24:17","if they have a choice. You're
bringing in an outsider who"
"672","00:40:24:17","00:40:27:09","doesn't know the company and
doesn't know the product, I'm"
"673","00:40:27:09","00:40:30:07","generally much more effective in
that first quarter, or quarter"
"674","00:40:30:07","00:40:33:09","and a half. And fixing
organizational issues, and"
"675","00:40:33:09","00:40:37:06","process issues and goal issues,
I'm never gonna be smart enough"
"676","00:40:37:06","00:40:41:03","about your product in three
months, to really have strong"
"677","00:40:41:03","00:40:43:10","opinions about the product
details."
"678","00:40:43:12","00:40:48:04","So generally, I'm called in when
it's really broken. And I want"
"679","00:40:48:04","00:40:50:12","to leave as soon as possible.
And the company wants me to help"
"680","00:40:50:12","00:40:54:24","them hiring a replacement as
soon as possible. Because every"
"681","00:40:54:24","00:40:57:24","company deserves a full time
head of product, who has the"
"682","00:40:57:24","00:41:02:02","long term understands the trade
offs, loves the customers with"
"683","00:41:02:02","00:41:06:06","all their heart and soul, and
understands how to move the"
"684","00:41:06:06","00:41:09:10","other executive players around
the board. So we get the right"
"685","00:41:09:10","00:41:12:21","things built and shipped. And
that's a lot of internal"
"686","00:41:12:21","00:41:14:23","discovery. It's a lot of
relationship building."
"687","00:41:16:05","00:41:18:21","The one dirty secret here, which
since we're recording"
"688","00:41:18:21","00:41:22:23","everybody's going to know is as
the interim, here's here's my"
"689","00:41:22:23","00:41:26:03","other office manager, by the
way, as the interim head of"
"690","00:41:26:04","00:41:29:08","product, I can say and do things
that no full time employee would"
"691","00:41:29:08","00:41:34:03","ever say or do. I can be as
blunt with the CEO and pull them"
"692","00:41:34:03","00:41:36:18","aside for coaching about things
that you would never do if you"
"693","00:41:36:18","00:41:39:24","want to keep your job, because
I'm leaving anyway. And there's"
"694","00:41:39:24","00:41:43:17","no stock options for me. And
there's no bonus for me. My job"
"695","00:41:43:17","00:41:47:03","is to clean it up and get the
heck out. And so I have a lot"
"696","00:41:47:03","00:41:51:02","more freedom of movement. But
for a limited time, because you"
"697","00:41:51:02","00:41:54:01","don't get away with that for
more than a quarter or two. And"
"698","00:41:54:04","00:41:58:00","I'm usually burned out by then
anyway, so time to go home. I"
"699","00:41:58:00","00:42:01:16","can't I can't tell you that
that's something you would love."
"700","00:42:02:12","00:42:04:06","But it's strong medicine when
you need it."
"701","00:42:10:12","00:42:14:10","Well, that was actually a reason
for picking on picking on Jeff."
"702","00:42:15:00","00:42:21:08","He asked that question earlier
on about relative roles, or"
"703","00:42:21:10","00:42:26:17","roles of head of product versus
some of the other bits of the"
"704","00:42:26:17","00:42:28:18","team. Jeff, do you want to
speak?"
"705","00:42:29:00","00:42:33:07","The question that Tomas asked in
rich well answered to pretty"
"706","00:42:33:07","00:42:37:10","much covered the majority of
that, like from the standpoint"
"707","00:42:37:10","00:42:40:21","that? Yeah, I think there's this
really interesting thing where"
"708","00:42:40:21","00:42:43:10","this sort of there's these
accountabilities, probably the"
"709","00:42:43:12","00:42:47:07","the product team typically has
that there is responsibilities"
"710","00:42:47:07","00:42:49:23","are tough to fall through. And,
again, I thought rich painted it"
"711","00:42:49:23","00:42:51:16","really well. Maybe the only
thing I would add, there was the"
"712","00:42:51:16","00:42:54:05","other nuance was, yeah, if we
were just complete a more"
"713","00:42:54:05","00:42:59:20","organizational picture. And that
same sort of vein, what then is"
"714","00:42:59:20","00:43:02:16","the accountabilities of, say
engineering and maybe marketing"
"715","00:43:02:16","00:43:05:17","in this role of figuring out the
product. Conversely, to it Rich"
"716","00:43:05:17","00:43:07:18","said, because there's this
interesting trend, where some"
"717","00:43:07:18","00:43:10:00","people have talked about how
product management is a"
"718","00:43:10:00","00:43:12:22","separate, not as a role. It's
obviously a very important role"
"719","00:43:12:22","00:43:15:07","in the company to, to focus on
these accountabilities. But"
"720","00:43:15:07","00:43:19:07","that, as a separate vertical
department in a company is a"
"721","00:43:19:09","00:43:23:01","could be a little problematic.
In other words, why isn't"
"722","00:43:23:01","00:43:25:09","product considered part of the
engineering organization, for"
"723","00:43:25:09","00:43:27:16","example, an organization right."
"724","00:43:27:17","00:43:30:14","And the challenge, if you have a
13 person company, you can't"
"725","00:43:30:14","00:43:34:18","have I mean, 13 departments, but
I observe that the engineering"
"726","00:43:34:18","00:43:39:01","team is really measured and
rewarded by getting things done."
"727","00:43:40:04","00:43:42:08","But they're not measured and
rewarded for getting the right"
"728","00:43:42:08","00:43:45:16","things done. And it's not their
competency to make that call."
"729","00:43:45:22","00:43:50:08","And on the marketing side, in a
good company, we've got a"
"730","00:43:50:08","00:43:53:00","product focus one. And so
marketing is really focusing on"
"731","00:43:53:00","00:43:57:20","the outbound positioning and
segmentation, and nurturing and"
"732","00:43:57:20","00:44:00:19","all the things that are that are
core to marketing. In general,"
"733","00:44:00:19","00:44:05:01","the marketing folks are a little
lightweight in terms of product"
"734","00:44:05:01","00:44:08:23","knowledge and internals. When we
have marketing folks spec out"
"735","00:44:08:23","00:44:12:14","products, we have really good
UX, but nothing under the hood,"
"736","00:44:12:19","00:44:15:07","soy, soy products sort of
halfway between. But in every"
"737","00:44:15:07","00:44:17:20","organization, we draw the line
in a different place. There's no"
"738","00:44:17:20","00:44:22:10","perfect, and it's so much about
how the different execs are"
"739","00:44:22:10","00:44:25:24","going to divide up the world
where they are the work in a way"
"740","00:44:25:24","00:44:30:05","that everybody can get along and
the fistfights in the alleys or"
"741","00:44:30:05","00:44:35:18","the the aisles of the office are
minimized. One last thought and"
"742","00:44:35:18","00:44:36:11","then I'll close."
"743","00:44:37:16","00:44:41:09","We've got a few more questions.
Emily. Emily, could you just say"
"744","00:44:41:09","00:44:42:00","something."
"745","00:44:45:16","00:44:50:09","I don't reload because people
get distracted but yeah, there"
"746","00:44:50:09","00:44:54:05","we go. That's my background
everybody. Self esteem boost for"
"747","00:44:54:05","00:44:54:15","the day."
"748","00:44:55:15","00:45:00:01","For Emily, there's a couple of
questions and then quite a few"
"749","00:45:00:01","00:45:03:10","You're different people asking
about early stage companies,"
"750","00:45:03:10","00:45:09:07","Nick mer or Ben Ebong. Do you
want to pipe up and talk about"
"751","00:45:09:08","00:45:11:08","pm and roles and
responsibilities?"
"752","00:45:13:17","00:45:17:14","Yeah, hey, guys. Hey, rich, I
think you mentioned when you"
"753","00:45:17:14","00:45:23:11","should invest in a PLM,
essentially around a 12 person"
"754","00:45:23:12","00:45:26:01","team when you get to that stage,
but what happens if you're"
"755","00:45:26:01","00:45:29:23","trying to get to that stage? Who
should be tackling those roles"
"756","00:45:29:23","00:45:33:11","and responsibilities? And how do
you do that effectively? Maybe"
"757","00:45:33:11","00:45:35:15","you're a Product Manager and
CEO, maybe you're not."
"758","00:45:38:11","00:45:42:12","It's a real challenge. Yeah. And
I'm not I'm seeing more true"
"759","00:45:42:12","00:45:45:06","startups two, and three and five
person startups where one of"
"760","00:45:45:06","00:45:50:03","those folks is, in fact, at
heart, a product manager. And I"
"761","00:45:50:03","00:45:54:20","think that gets us along the
discovery or validation track"
"762","00:45:54:20","00:45:57:06","really fast, I just don't see
most companies being able to"
"763","00:45:57:06","00:46:03:07","afford it. Right. So and that
person's even, even if they're"
"764","00:46:03:12","00:46:06:12","100% product originally, they're
probably doing three other jobs,"
"765","00:46:06:12","00:46:08:18","right? At a startup, we're all
doing a bunch of jobs."
"766","00:46:08:18","00:46:12:13","So what I'd say is, I think it's
really, really important or"
"767","00:46:12:13","00:46:15:09","useful for a startup to have
somebody who's got product"
"768","00:46:15:09","00:46:18:17","management experience. But I'm
not sure at a four person"
"769","00:46:18:17","00:46:22:03","company that we're going to have
anybody whose sole job and name"
"770","00:46:22:03","00:46:25:14","tag says Product Management
because there's, there's not"
"771","00:46:25:14","00:46:27:24","enough division of labor in a
company that size."
"772","00:46:28:09","00:46:30:10","I was just gonna pick something
up because Kevin Davis had a"
"773","00:46:30:10","00:46:32:18","good comment here, full
disclosure had been fired more"
"774","00:46:32:18","00:46:35:12","than once in this failure mode.
I've got to tell you, I've been"
"775","00:46:35:12","00:46:40:17","fired more than once in this
failure mode, too. So only, you"
"776","00:46:40:17","00:46:44:17","know, a handful of times, but it
was very instructive and good to"
"777","00:46:44:17","00:46:47:14","deflate my ego from where I
thought it was. Okay, I'm sorry,"
"778","00:46:47:14","00:46:49:00","Mark, you were going to take us
somewhere else?"
"779","00:46:49:04","00:46:52:12","Yeah, I was just gonna ask John
Saltz, if he wants to talk about"
"780","00:46:52:12","00:46:56:05","where product marketing should
fit."
"781","00:46:57:01","00:47:01:13","Yes. You mentioned the marketing
sort of spectrum between"
"782","00:47:01:13","00:47:04:00","marketing and product
management. I'm wondering"
"783","00:47:04:00","00:47:07:13","product marketing. Yeah, big
enough where you need product"
"784","00:47:07:13","00:47:10:12","marketing, which we're big
enough, right? Yeah. It's more"
"785","00:47:10:12","00:47:13:14","of knowing the products and then
doing the marketing function."
"786","00:47:13:14","00:47:14:14","What do you think about that?"
"787","00:47:15:04","00:47:21:01","I think, it's a hard call,
right. So when there's enough"
"788","00:47:21:01","00:47:23:05","product marketers, or enough
product marketing to have a"
"789","00:47:23:05","00:47:25:24","department, right, the two
choices one is to have it report"
"790","00:47:25:24","00:47:30:10","to marketing. And often the
product marketers feel a little"
"791","00:47:30:17","00:47:34:13","unloved and left out, because
they're doing something, you"
"792","00:47:34:13","00:47:37:23","know, somewhat more intellectual
is maybe a strong word, but it's"
"793","00:47:37:23","00:47:42:18","more content driven, it's more
subjective. It's very closely"
"794","00:47:42:18","00:47:47:11","tied to sales. And often the
product marketers feel unloved"
"795","00:47:47:11","00:47:52:00","by the demand gen side of the
house. But it's one of the two"
"796","00:47:52:00","00:47:55:09","choices. And at least, we know
that when we bring out a new"
"797","00:47:55:09","00:47:57:19","product, they'll be some
campaigns behind it, because"
"798","00:47:57:19","00:47:59:15","they're in the same
organization. And the messaging"
"799","00:47:59:15","00:48:03:17","will be good when we move it
under the head of product,"
"800","00:48:03:17","00:48:06:24","because sometimes I see product
marketing as part of the product"
"801","00:48:06:24","00:48:08:10","team next to product management."
"802","00:48:09:10","00:48:12:04","What we've done is on the
positive side, we're getting a"
"803","00:48:12:04","00:48:15:09","lot better communications
between the product marketers"
"804","00:48:15:09","00:48:17:23","and the product managers were
much more likely to describe the"
"805","00:48:17:23","00:48:20:22","products correctly, to know who
they're for to have that stuff."
"806","00:48:21:05","00:48:24:19","But often what we've lost is the
really tight connection to the"
"807","00:48:24:19","00:48:28:19","rest of marketing. So there's
this pendulum effect. Sometimes"
"808","00:48:28:19","00:48:31:21","I see where we have product
marketing on the marketing side"
"809","00:48:31:21","00:48:35:19","for 15 months, and then we
decide it would be better on the"
"810","00:48:35:19","00:48:39:14","product side for 15 months, and
then we think it would be better"
"811","00:48:39:14","00:48:43:03","on the marketing side for 15
months. And those folks get a"
"812","00:48:43:03","00:48:49:06","little whiplash. But, you know,
I think all product folks figure"
"813","00:48:49:06","00:48:52:23","out that we have to fill the gap
that the organization creates."
"814","00:48:53:02","00:48:56:15","So no matter how we divide
people up, there are natural"
"815","00:48:56:15","00:49:00:18","gaps. And as the product folks,
we have to see those we have to"
"816","00:49:00:18","00:49:05:05","reach across we have to be
triply quadruple ly pushy about"
"817","00:49:05:05","00:49:07:24","communicating and loving the
folks across the gap because"
"818","00:49:08:15","00:49:12:12","everybody is across the aisle
from us. And, you know, we're"
"819","00:49:12:12","00:49:18:10","always papering over whatever
division we created. To non"
"820","00:49:18:10","00:49:19:18","answer, but it's my answer."
"821","00:49:20:24","00:49:25:24","Right, Patrick Quinn, who
traditionally if he doesn't ask"
"822","00:49:29:20","00:49:37:09","a number of questions at any BoS
Conference. Isn't really at the"
"823","00:49:37:09","00:49:41:23","conference. Patrick, you've got
a question about experience"
"824","00:49:41:24","00:49:42:19","knowledge."
"825","00:49:43:04","00:49:47:11","And and it looks like that's
about Scrum and Agile. So I'll"
"826","00:49:47:11","00:49:52:00","pick up Patrick's question. So I
think it's essential. I think"
"827","00:49:52:00","00:49:54:21","it's required that product
managers really understand how"
"828","00:49:54:21","00:49:59:08","their software is built. I think
there's no excuse for that. And"
"829","00:49:59:08","00:50:03:24","so we have to be agile
practitioners, right? We and but"
"830","00:50:03:24","00:50:07:00","in the broad sense, not in
honest again, I don't care if"
"831","00:50:07:00","00:50:10:00","you're Kanban or Scrum or
halfway in between your XP,"
"832","00:50:10:00","00:50:12:11","you're right. I've been at this
game so long that I know that"
"833","00:50:12:11","00:50:16:17","those are all right solutions
for some situations, I don't"
"834","00:50:16:17","00:50:19:21","think the product folks get to
be dogmatic about how the"
"835","00:50:19:21","00:50:22:17","software is built. It's not
their call. But we have to know"
"836","00:50:22:17","00:50:26:15","where we fit in. And probably
three places where it's really"
"837","00:50:26:15","00:50:30:22","important one is, we have to get
our problem statements or"
"838","00:50:30:22","00:50:33:10","whatever they are in the right
format. So our engineers and"
"839","00:50:33:10","00:50:36:04","developers are actually going to
engage with them. Notice, I"
"840","00:50:36:04","00:50:38:14","didn't say solutions, I said
problems, right."
"841","00:50:39:13","00:50:43:03","The second is, I think we need
to be in every retrospective,"
"842","00:50:43:16","00:50:46:18","because so many of the issues
that come up on our development"
"843","00:50:46:18","00:50:51:09","teams are out of scope for the
developers themselves, right?"
"844","00:50:51:09","00:50:54:16","They can't fix organizational
problems, they can't fix lack of"
"845","00:50:54:16","00:50:58:08","focus on the sales side. They
can't fix weird, you know,"
"846","00:50:58:08","00:51:01:24","things that marketing's doing,
and and so my product managers"
"847","00:51:01:24","00:51:05:03","and I show up to the
retrospectives. So we take"
"848","00:51:05:03","00:51:09:13","assignments out of that to go
fix things, or lobby folks who"
"849","00:51:09:13","00:51:12:20","are outside the development team
that are blocking things for"
"850","00:51:12:20","00:51:13:20","development, right."
"851","00:51:13:23","00:51:18:10","And then the third one is, we as
product folks are the semi"
"852","00:51:18:10","00:51:21:14","permeable shields were the
blockers to everybody who wants"
"853","00:51:21:14","00:51:24:11","to interrupt the current sprint,
I was just working with somebody"
"854","00:51:24:11","00:51:29:05","yesterday. And we defined the
conditions under which somebody"
"855","00:51:29:05","00:51:33:04","else in the company can break
the sprint, and it is the list"
"856","00:51:33:04","00:51:38:05","of one and it is p zero system
down. Customers can't use our"
"857","00:51:38:05","00:51:43:04","software, right? If our cloud is
offline, if our users can't log"
"858","00:51:43:04","00:51:45:22","in or enter data, we all stop
what we're doing, and we get it"
"859","00:51:45:22","00:51:49:17","fixed. But anything other than
that product managers have to"
"860","00:51:49:17","00:51:53:03","throw their bodies in the way of
all the other interrupts there's"
"861","00:51:53:03","00:51:56:12","nothing so important that we
can't wait a half a week until"
"862","00:51:56:12","00:52:01:01","the next sprint starts. And so
we have to live the Agile story,"
"863","00:52:01:01","00:52:04:15","we have to be part of the Agile
story. But I don't actually care"
"864","00:52:04:15","00:52:07:18","about the details that happen,
you know that the inside"
"865","00:52:07:18","00:52:11:08","baseball inside the sprint,
other than that the team's"
"866","00:52:11:08","00:52:17:06","working and I can help them. So
there's an outer loop, agile"
"867","00:52:17:06","00:52:20:13","here, as opposed to the inner
loop agile of single story"
"868","00:52:20:13","00:52:23:20","single points. Right? How do we
support agile as an"
"869","00:52:23:20","00:52:28:01","organization's organization?
Awesome. Thank you. Cool."
"870","00:52:28:21","00:52:32:14","All right. Ben McDonald. So what
are your thoughts on pragmatic"
"871","00:52:32:14","00:52:37:06","marketing framework? But let's
extend that I mean, the almost"
"872","00:52:37:06","00:52:39:00","infinite number of frameworks."
"873","00:52:39:00","00:52:42:01","Yeah. And for everything, I
guess, and I know, the pragmatic"
"874","00:52:42:01","00:52:44:13","folks are really smart, and
they're helping educate up the"
"875","00:52:44:13","00:52:47:19","product, folks, here's my
observation. There are, I don't"
"876","00:52:47:19","00:52:51:01","know, maybe no more than a dozen
or two different frameworks for"
"877","00:52:51:01","00:52:56:14","product management, they are all
morally the same. You know, you"
"878","00:52:56:14","00:52:58:18","need to have your own framework,
if you're going to put it on"
"879","00:52:58:18","00:53:01:13","your logo and promote it and
sell books and put people"
"880","00:53:01:13","00:53:06:04","through your class. But I've
never actually found anybody who"
"881","00:53:06:04","00:53:11:05","directly implements any of them
as written. So first of all,"
"882","00:53:11:06","00:53:14:20","they're just boxes on a page
with some templates. Going to a"
"883","00:53:14:20","00:53:18:01","class for two days does not
teach you how to be a product"
"884","00:53:18:01","00:53:18:12","manager."
"885","00:53:18:22","00:53:22:12","My good friend Scott Sal Horst
out of Austin taught me that a"
"886","00:53:22:12","00:53:25:21","weekend at the dude ranch
doesn't make you a cowboy."
"887","00:53:26:17","00:53:31:12","Right. And so it's true mark,
sorry. So I know that I want to"
"888","00:53:31:12","00:53:34:10","send my folks off maybe to a
class or two, because we're"
"889","00:53:34:10","00:53:37:13","gonna get a common vocabulary,
and we're gonna maybe have some"
"890","00:53:37:13","00:53:41:14","common templates, you know, get
on the same tools. But none of"
"891","00:53:41:14","00:53:44:15","that is the essence of product
management, the essence of"
"892","00:53:44:15","00:53:48:22","product management is embroiling
yourself in lots of customer"
"893","00:53:48:22","00:53:51:19","issues, and really, really,
really deeply understanding and"
"894","00:53:51:19","00:53:55:07","empathizing with what they need.
And then bringing that stuff"
"895","00:53:55:07","00:53:58:24","back to your development team,
where the much smarter folks are"
"896","00:53:58:24","00:54:02:14","going to help you figure out how
to solve it. And the workflows"
"897","00:54:02:14","00:54:05:21","are useful. But every time we
come to a new company, we blow"
"898","00:54:05:21","00:54:07:17","up those workflows and start
some new ones."
"899","00:54:07:21","00:54:12:16","So I wouldn't confuse the grid
or the matrix or the flow"
"900","00:54:12:16","00:54:16:07","through diagram. With the
essential content. It's the same"
"901","00:54:16:07","00:54:19:07","problem as I don't know if you
guys know this, but writing a"
"902","00:54:19:07","00:54:24:00","book is just a matter of putting
100,000 words in a file. Now,"
"903","00:54:24:07","00:54:28:18","writing a good book is putting
the correct 100,000 words in the"
"904","00:54:28:18","00:54:33:11","file. And it's easy to get
confused between I showed up I"
"905","00:54:33:11","00:54:37:08","was in a meeting, I wrote a user
story and anything of value. So,"
"906","00:54:37:13","00:54:40:04","you know, let's just be cautious
about how much you can learn in"
"907","00:54:40:04","00:54:45:01","two days of a survey course,
rather than two years of living"
"908","00:54:45:01","00:54:48:12","with your mistakes by staying on
the same product long enough"
"909","00:54:48:12","00:54:49:17","that they all come back to bite
you."
"910","00:54:52:21","00:54:57:16","Amazing. One last question. If
someone's got something rich,"
"911","00:54:57:16","00:55:00:22","you rattle through these so
quickly. Alright. I rattled."
"912","00:55:01:06","00:55:03:04","Let's don't apologize."
"913","00:55:03:04","00:55:07:03","Alright, so I have, I have one
last thought here, which, for"
"914","00:55:07:03","00:55:10:04","those of you who thought this
was going to be something you"
"915","00:55:10:04","00:55:14:06","wanted to emulate, right?
Whenever anybody comes up to me"
"916","00:55:14:06","00:55:16:24","and says they think they might
want to become a product"
"917","00:55:16:24","00:55:20:19","manager, or even worse, a
product leader, I think it's my"
"918","00:55:20:19","00:55:24:20","obligation spend the next 10 or
15 minutes, arguing the other"
"919","00:55:24:20","00:55:28:20","side. It's a, it's a
fascinating, wonderful, narrow"
"920","00:55:28:20","00:55:32:04","position. Most folks don't want
it most folks don't succeed at"
"921","00:55:32:04","00:55:36:01","it. It's not that much fun. I
observed that really smart folks"
"922","00:55:36:01","00:55:39:03","do product management for a few
years, and then something more"
"923","00:55:39:03","00:55:43:01","rewarding. And that's only
useful if I can tell you I"
"924","00:55:43:01","00:55:45:04","wasn't so smart because I've
been in product management for"
"925","00:55:45:05","00:55:55:06","30 plus years. So II OMEOJ
Whatever. Oh, nobody's old"
"926","00:55:55:06","00:55:58:21","enough. And anybody tell me what
the last punch card in the stack"
"927","00:55:58:21","00:56:05:05","says. And that's only useful
because each time I've been"
"928","00:56:05:05","00:56:09:10","fired, the three letters I write
on my whiteboard on my way out R"
"929","00:56:09:11","00:56:15:18","E. O. J. I put an away message
you said 404. Vice President not"
"930","00:56:15:18","00:56:22:12","found Nice. Okay. Great. Thanks
for everybody's attention. And"
"931","00:56:22:15","00:56:24:16","for Mark and the team for
letting me come play"
